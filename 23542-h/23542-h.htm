<h2>THE LIBERTY OF FRANZ<br />
AND THE<br />
REBELLION OF FUZZY WUZZY</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Madame Morelli</span>, the pretty
little Frenchwoman who makes a
half-score of leopards, panthers
and jaguars do things which nature never
intended them to do, had finished her act
and driven the snarling performers through
the narrow runway to their separate cages,
fastening each one, as she thought, securely.
Two French clowns were filling in the time
and making the audience of Coney Island
pleasure seekers laugh by their antics with
a performing dog, while the stage hands
were bringing in the properties for the next
trained animal act, when the Proprietor
came from behind the scenes and strolled,
apparently unconcerned, to the back of
the Arena, where he could command a
clear view of the performance, the audience<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
and the cages. He said a few words to
each of the trainers and keepers whom he
passed, and the Stranger, who knew the
clock-like regularity with which each one of
them went through his allotted duties, noticed
an unwonted haste and suppressed excitement
among them.</p>

<p>As he joined the Proprietor the sound of
hammering mingled with the noise of the
blatant brass band and the cries of the ballyhoo
spielers for the other Dreamland attractions,
which came in through the open windows,
and he saw that Stevenson, the mild
eyed quiet man who is always on hand to
rescue imperiled trainers and keepers when
their own carelessness, or unexpected revolt
on the part of the animals, leads to a fight,
was rapidly nailing boards over the ventilating
spaces above the cages. Madam Morelli,
whip and training rod in hand, hurried from
her dressing room to the runway, and every
keeper and trainer seemed to be loitering in
the space between the leopards' den and the
audience.</p>

<p>He looked at the Proprietor inquiringly,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
but the little trickle of blood which ran down
his cheek from under his cap answered the
question he would have asked, an animal was
loose and the Proprietor had encountered it
in his rounds. A crash of weird music from
the band drowned the sound of a cracking
whip and sharp commands which came from
the runway, and announced the appearance<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
of Brandu, the snake charmer, in the exhibition
cage, and the audience watched him play
with a cobra, all unconscious that Franz, the
jaguar, which a few minutes before had
desisted from his attempt to tear the fair
shoulders of Morelli only after a dozen
blank cartridges had been fired in his face,
was a gentleman-at-large in Dreamland.
The Proprietor gave a sigh of relief as the
jaguar backed into his cage from the runway,
snarling and striking at the little
woman who forced him backward with the
whip until she was able to slam the door and
make him once more a prisoner. When she
passed them on her way back to the dressing-room,
her dress was torn, and her eyes were
flashing from the excitement of the encounter
and anger at the carelessness of the carpenter
who had left a board loose at the top
of the den.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 564px;"><a name="The_table_in_front_of_the_Arena" id="The_table_in_front_of_the_Arena"></a>
<img src="images/001.png" width="564" height="500" alt="" title="" />
The table in front of the Arena.</div>

<p>"Of course, that might have been a serious
thing for the jaguar and for my pocket
book," said the Proprietor as three deep
scratches in his head were being plastered
up. "I couldn't afford to take any chances<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
of an accident, and he would have been shot
if he had attempted to come through a ventilator
into the Arena, but a trained animal
like that is worth a goodish bit of money.
He let me know he was loose by giving me
his love pat when I was walking through
the runway, and as Morelli is the only one
who can do anything with him I sent for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
her. She can whip considerably more than
her own weight in wild-cats, and there was
not the slightest danger to the audience, but
not many men would have relished her task
of going into that passage with the beast
loose on top of the cages." He negatived the
Press Agent's suggestion to make a scare-head
story of the escape for the papers, and
suggested that they should go up and hear
Madam Morelli's account of it. She was sitting
on the edge of her bed, mending a rip
which the jaguar's sharp claws had made in
her gown, and she shrugged her shoulders
when the Stranger inquired if she had been
hurt.</p>

<img src="images/002.png" width="518" height="500" alt="" title="" />
Two French clowns and a performing dog.</div>

<p>"It was nothing," she said laughing. "He
jumped at me from the top of a cage when
I came in, but I beat him off and whipped
him back into his cage. It was only the close
quarters which made it bad, for I am used
to fighting them." She was interrupted by
a yapping and caterwauling in the doorway,
and sprang on the bed, her face white with
terror, as a small terrier and the menagerie
cat rolled into the room in a clawing, biting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
mix-up. The terrier was raising a litter of
puppies in the next room, and the cat had
transformed the space back of Morelli's bed
into a feline nursery, and a meeting of the
two anxious mothers in the hall had led to
trouble. Madam Morelli always goes
through her performance in an evening
dress, and she stood on the bed, her long train
gathered closely about her, trembling like a
leaf, when the Proprietor finally separated
the combatants and restored peace.</p>

<p>"You wouldn't think that a woman who
had just come from a fight with a two hundred
pound jaguar, which could easily tear
her to pieces, would be scared at a scrap between
a toy terrier and a mongrel cat," said
the Proprietor, laughing, as he led the way
to the caf&eacute; table. "But she makes a specialty
of the larger species."</p>

<p>"This matter of specialties seems to run
through every branch of the show business,"
said the Press Agent as they took their seats
at the table. "I ran a dime museum in St.
Louis a few years ago&mdash;in those days there
was lots of money in it&mdash;and the freaks<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
would never stand for any change in their
billing. We used to have a fresh lot sent on
by our New York agent every two weeks,
and one Monday morning when I went
down to look over the new arrivals, I knew
that he had been up against the demon Rum,
when he engaged such a tough looking
bunch. The alleged fat woman looked as
if she was wasting away with consumption,
and the bearded lady had a way of absentmindedly
humming the popular airs in a
bass voice which gave the whole snap away.
There was one likely looking girl and when
I asked her what she was she told me she was
the web-footed lady and showed me her feet,
which had little pieces of skin growing between
the toes.</p>

<p>"I knew that wasn't good enough, so I
told her she was mistaken; that she was a
Circassian beauty, and I gave her a wig and
the fixings and put her on the platform. But
say, would you believe it? She was so mad
and embarrassed by the change in her stunt
that when the lecturer was calling attention
to her blond beauty, she would blush until<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
she looked like an Indian Princess, and every
time he turned his back she would take off
her shoes and wiggle her toes at the audience
to show what she really was.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 543px;"><a name="Things_which_Nature_never_intended_them_to_do" id="Things_which_Nature_never_intended_them_to_do"></a>
<img src="images/003.png" width="543" height="500" alt="" title="" />
"Things which Nature never intended them to do."</div>



<p>"It was up to us to get some real attraction
to tide over the time until our agent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
should get sober and send us another bunch
of freaks, so Merritt, who was my partner,
and myself hunted up a big buck nigger and
made a deal with him to go on as a 'Wild
Man.' We ripped up a hair mattress and
glued the contents onto him, and wired a
couple of big tusks to his teeth, and with an
iron collar around his neck and a log chain
around his waist he was as good an imitation
as was ever faked. We put him in a big
cage which we had used the week before
for a mangy old lion; one of the five hundred
or so 'Wallace the Untamables' which
were touring the country, and Merritt
taught him to howl like a steam calliope.</p>

<p>"We called him 'Fuzzy Wuzzy, the Terrible
Man-Eating Cannibal,' which was a
waste of words, but Merritt had language
to burn. He had got hold of a phony five
hundred dollar bill, and when he was giving
his spiel about how Fuzzy Wuzzy was captured
upon a desert island, where he was
found chewing a human leg, and how he
couldn't eat anything but raw meat, and was
always trying to get at his keeper for dessert,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
he would wave his phony five hundred
spot over his head and give it to 'em good.</p>

<p>"'Five hundred dollars, ladies and gents,
I will give to any man who will remain for
the short space of two minutes in the cage
with Fuzzy Wuzzy! Five hundred dollars
to any man who is brave enough to run the
risk of letting this terrible man-eating cannibal
get his hinder limbs about him, for
then all would be lost and Fuzzy Wuzzy
would fasten his terrible fangs in his victim's
throat and suck his ber-lud.'</p>

<p>"Well, it was a good spiel, all right, all
right, and when Merritt struck that part one
of the supers would prod up old Fuzzy, who
would rattle his chains and howl for fair, and
the audience would get cold chills down their
backs. We were playing to the S. R. O.,
and giving so many shows a day that Merritt
pretty nearly lost his voice, and Fuzzy
had been prodded so much that he had to
take his meals standing up. We ran 'em
through pretty fast, and one afternoon Merritt
was just going to give the 'All out'
signal, which cleared the exhibition hall for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
the next performance, when up steps a big
husky black roustabout from the levee and
commences to strip off his coat.</p>

<p>"'Jes' a minit, boss,' says he. 'Ah reckon
ah needs dat five hundred in mah bizness,'
and Merritt looks at him in astonishment.</p>

<p>"'My deluded colored brother,' says he,
'Do you appreciate the fact that you are
going to a certain and horrible death? If
this terrible Fuzzy Wuzzy gets his hinder
limbs about you he will suck your ber-lud.'</p>

<p>"'Ah doan reckon he'll git me, an' ah suttenly
needs de money,' answers the coon, and
continues to strip, and Merritt sizes him up
and sees the finish of Fuzzy Wuzzy, who was
shaking the bars and trying to get away
from the super who was prodding him; but
everybody thought he was trying to get at
the coon to make a meal of him, and some
of the women folks were getting hysterics.
One of the boys had put me wise, and I
broke through the crowd and called a halt in
the proceedings.</p>

<p>"'Ladies and gentlemen,' says I, 'I didn't
believe that a man existed who was foolhardy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
enough to be tempted to certain death
by the lure of a paltry five hundred dollars.
But although this man is so reckless of his
own life, I must insist that he get a permit
from the mayor, relieving us from all responsibility,
before we allow him to be torn
limb from limb. Return to-morrow at two
o'clock, and if this man's courage still keeps
up, you will see before your shuddering eyes
an encounter which will make the historical
gladiatorial combats of ancient Rome pale
into insignificance.' I could sling a few language
myself, those days, and the mayor
was a friend of mine&mdash;or I thought he was&mdash;so
I figured we could catch the suckers for
an admission and then call it off, because he
would refuse a permit.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 470px;"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15"></a>
<img src="images/004.png" width="470" height="500" alt="" title="" />
"Blank cartridges fired in his face."</div>



<p>"But he was onto the game and he was one
of those blame fools who thought he had a
sense of humor, so he gives him a document
with a big red seal on it which looks like a
doctor's diploma, which says that Thomas
Jefferson is allowed to go in and win our
five hundred, and the next day the coon
shows up smiling and ready, and I knew we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
had to make good somehow. I passed the
word to Merritt to delay the game and make
a last grand effort to throw a scare into the
coon, and he put up a spiel to beat the band.</p>

<p>"'This terrible Fuzzy Wuzzy has none of
the attributes of a human being,' says he.
'He lives upon raw meat and would prefer
human flesh if he could get it. Observe the
expression of ghoulish glee in his eyes as he
regards the foolhardy man who will soon
furnish him such a meal as he formerly enjoyed
in his native jungle. He sleeps at
night suspended from the top bars of his
cage by his claw-like hands and feet, which
will soon be tearing the flesh of this man
who stands before you now, a picture of
perfect health and strength. He speaks no
intelligible language, but he utters howls
and yells, which will be more horrible than
ever before when he is sucking the warm
heart's be-lud of the figure which you see
before you for the last time in human shape.'
Just then the super gives Fuzzy a prod and
he howls like Balaam's ass, but the coon
stands there smiling and not feazed a bit.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>"'It's a sad sight,' continues Merritt, 'to
see a fine man in the prime of life, like our
colored brother here, crushed into an unrecognizable
mass by the terrible hinder limbs
of this man-eating cannibal and then torn to
shreds by his horrible fangs. The management
of this highly moral and intellectual
show will provide a funeral for the remains,
if there are any, and now, ladies and gents,
I call upon you to witness that we are not
responsible for the terrible end which awaits
this reckless man.'</p>

<p>"I had taken the precaution to button up
the box office 'take' in my inside pocket, and
while Merritt was making a bluff at looking
for the key to the cage door I looked
around to see that there was a free exit, for
the coon was standing there swelling out his
chest and grinning as if he had the five hundred
already in his jeans, and I knew he
couldn't be bluffed out. Just then a typical
antebellum Missourian, one of the kind that
has to be shown, steps up in front. He was
tanked up until his safety valve would have
blown off if it hadn't been wired down, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
he was pretty steady on his pins when he held
onto the railing in front of the cage.</p>

"Five hundred dollars to any
one who will enter the cage."</div>



<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>"'Professah,' says he, 'did I undahstand
yo' all correctly to say that this yeah object
in the cage has none of the attributes of the
human race?'</p>

<p>"'Correct!' says Merritt, glad of an excuse
to delay things. 'He is lower than the
beasts of the field.'</p>

<p>"'Well, he suttenly aint much to look at,'
says the Southerner, looking him over carefully.
'He won't eat like folks&mdash;he can't
talk&mdash;an' he sleeps like a bat. I dunno why
such a pusillanimous critter should cumber
the yearth,' and with that he puts his hand
to his hip and pulls out a forty-five from
under the tails of his coat. Fuzzy takes one
look at it, and it didn't need any prodding to
make him holler, and he tries to tear off the
false tusks.</p>

<p>"'Foh Gawd's sake, mistah, doan shoot!'
he yells. 'Dat white mahn's been tellin' a
passel ob lies about me until ah's sartain
suah somefing gwine fer to git me. Ah can
eat an' talk like any one, an' mos' ebery one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
knows me about yeah wen ah ain't got dese
yeah contraptions on.'</p>

<p>"'Shut up, you blame fool!' says Merritt.
'He won't shoot you.'</p>

<p>"'Mebbe he knows dat, mebbe you knows
dat; but how does I know dat?' yells Fuzzy.
'Dat gun suttenly looks big to me.'</p>

<p>"About this time the other coon got wise
and saw the five hundred vanishing, and the
last I saw of Merritt he was trying to break
a half-Nelson that the coon had got on him
and dodge the rest of the crowd at the same
time. I left St. Louis on a freight that
night, wearing a few lumps where some
stray brickbats landed, and the next time I
saw Merritt was in Chicago, and he was on
crutches and had his head covered with
plaster."</p>

<p>No thunderbolt dropped from the blue
dome over the Dreamland tower, and the
Proprietor, with a childlike and bland smile
on his face, motioned to the waiter to refill
the glasses.</p>

<h2>THE BITE OF A RATTLER<br />
AND<br />
THE SAD FATE OF BIG PETE</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Like</span> the pitcher which went to the well
until it met the proverbial fate, the
trainer entered the lion's den once too
often, and what remained of him was
placed in an ambulance and taken to the
hospital. After the performance for the
evening was over, Baltimore, the bad lion,
who had suddenly developed a craving for
human flesh, had been dealt with by the Proprietor
of the menagerie in a manner which
would spoil his appetite for many a day to
come and make him remember that trainers
cannot be mangled with impunity.</p>

<p>Most of the lights were extinguished at
Dreamland, but two men sat at the table
in front of the Arena with the Proprietor,
discussing the accident and listening to stories
of former encounters which he related.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
His own body bears the scars of many a
battle with his savage charges, but he has
discontinued giving personal exhibitions
with them in the large cage, because his wife
has developed a prejudice against having
him brought to her in fragments, and he has
found that the training of trainers is a far
more difficult task than the education of wild
animals.</p>

<p>"Yes, any man who follows this business
carries his life in his hands," he said in answer
to a question from the Stranger within
the gates. "You helped to care for poor
Bonavita to-night, after Baltimore finished
with him, so you know what a lion's jaws
can do. I've seen 'em chewed up as bad as
that and get over it, but they never get quite
the same again. Leave the business? No;
it is like the sea: a man who takes to it keeps
it up until the time comes when he doesn't
recover, but after a bad accident he usually
takes another breed of animals.</p>

<p>"The worst sight I ever saw was about five
years ago, when one of our performing
bears turned on its trainer and seized<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
his arm. He worried
it as a terrier would a
bone for a good twenty
minutes before we could
drive him off, and the
bear died from the punishment
we gave him.
The man's arm isn't
much use to him now,
but he is crazy for me
to give him another
group of animals to
train, which I can't do
because a man needs
two good pairs of limbs
when he gets into the
exhibition cage." He
told of many accidents
which had happened to
himself and his employees,
most of them
through their own carelessness,
born of constant
association with
their charges who never<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
miss the opportunity which the shortest instant
of forgetfulness gives them.</p>

"A constant procession of small animals moving down his throat."</div>



<p>"I said that bear attack was the worst
sight I ever saw, and it was; but something
happened here last year which impressed me
more because it was so mysterious. A friend
of mine in Florida shipped me a box of rattlers,
which he wrote had been 'attended to,'
and I supposed that their poison fangs had
been extracted. They were delivered just
before the performance started and I ripped
a board off the box and stuck my hand in,
grabbing them one by one and throwing
them into the den as if they were garter
snakes.</p>

<p>"The man who took care of the snakes was
out on the ballyhoo, walking around with
the gander following him to advertise the
show; and when he came in he looked them
over and found that each one had as pretty a
pair of fangs as you would wish to see. He
told me about it and I confess that it gave
me a gone feeling in the pit of my stomach,
for I remembered how I had felt around for
them in the box with my bare hands.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am pretty busy while a performance
is going on, so I told him to let them alone
until I had a chance to examine them.
Ninety per cent. of the accidents which occur
in a menagerie comes from the disregard
of ordinary precautions or the disobedience
of orders, and I had a presentiment that
something was going to happen and I was
keeping an extra vigilant eye on the performers
in the big exhibition cage. Well, it
happened, all right; but not in the way that
I expected.</p>

<p>"The snake man instead of getting back
on the ballyhoo where he belonged, stood
around the snake cage, watching the new
rattlers, and along came a couple of gazabos
who commenced talking about them. One
of them was the wise guy, who always knows
about how the animals are doped so they
won't bite and all that other information
which isn't so. He commenced explaining
how the snakes were harmless, because their
teeth had been pulled, and giving a lot of
misinformation about them. The snake
man listened until he couldn't stand it any<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
longer and then he stuck his hand into the
cage and grabbed one of the rattlers by the
neck.</p>

<p>"'Fangs pulled, eh?' says he, and he made
the rattler open his mouth and show a perfect
pair of stingers. The wise guy took
one look at them and fled, and the snake man
would have carried it off all right, only he
was so busy calling a few choice names after
him that he placed the snake back in the cage
instead of throwing it in, and the rattler
struck him before he could draw his hand
out. He had a clown make-up on, so I
couldn't tell whether he was pale or not
when he came to me a few minutes later and
held out his hand, but there was a queer expression
on his face and I knew that my apprehensions
had not been groundless.</p>

<p>"There were just two little red dots, no
bigger than pin heads, on the back of his
hand.</p>

<p>"'You got it, didn't you?' says I.</p>

<p>"'Good and plenty,' says he. 'My arm
hurts me already.'</p>

<p>"We got busy right away and took him up<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
to the hospital where Bonavita is now. Say,
he was a very thin man and you can see that
I'm no lightweight; but by midnight the
right side of his body and his right arm and
leg were swollen to my size, and in the morning
all of the swollen part was as black as a
coal. He was suffering terribly, and I tried
to get hold of the Arab snake doctor but
couldn't locate him, so I wired to Rochester
for Rattlesnake Pete. He came down and
a mighty interesting man he is, but he
couldn't do anything which 'Doc' up at the
hospital hadn't done, and it was five days
before my man was out of danger. He was
not a drinking man&mdash;I finished having
drunkards around my show a good many
years ago&mdash;and the whiskey took right hold
of him and pulled him through. 'Doc' kept
squirting some red stuff into his arm, but it
was the 'red-eye' which saved him&mdash;and that
reminds me."</p>

"The wise guy."</div>



<p>He beckoned to the waiter and each one
ordered his favorite antidote for a possible
snake bite.</p>

<p>"Did he return to the show?" asked the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
Stranger, after he had rendered himself immune.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 333px;"><a name="Noah_listens_to_the_tale_of_a_Johnstown_flood_survivor" id="Noah_listens_to_the_tale_of_a_Johnstown_flood_survivor"></a>

Noah listens to the tale of a Johnstown flood survivor.</div>

<p>"He sure did; you couldn't keep him
away, but he has never been fond of snakes
since. It is the same man whom you saw
putting the group of elephants through
their paces to-night."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>It was growing late, and the Proprietor
announced that he was going to show his
wife a good husband and said good-night,
but the Stranger waited for the story which
he saw was trembling upon his companion's
lips, and induced the sleepy waiter to bring
a farewell dose of snake-bite antidote. The
man was unknown to him by name, but his
personality promised to be interesting, for
his face spoke of good living, the red of his
complexion was evidently not entirely due to
exposure to the sun, and the little sacs under
the eyes indicated that he was apt to be the
last of a convivial party to suggest breaking
up.</p>

<p>He had listened to the Proprietor's stories
with the same bored expression which Noah
might wear in hearing the experiences of a
survivor of the Johnstown flood, and he
looked regretfully at the vacant chair, now
that his turn had come.</p>

<p>"Snakes!" he exclaimed with a contemptuous
snort. "What does the boss
know about 'em? I used to own the only
snake that was worth having. Ever hear of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
'Big Pete'?" The Stranger confessed his
ignorance, and the other settled back in his
chair and lighted a fresh cigar.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you about him, then. You know
that a snake is a queer proposition in a menagerie.
They get sore mouths&mdash;canker the
fakirs call it&mdash;and won't eat, and then, if
you've got any investment in 'em you want
to get it out mighty quick, for they are no
orchids. I was pretty well on my uppers,
after a bad season on the road, when a guy
named Merritt came to me and said he
could get a fine snake cheap, and he thought
we might make some money out of him by
showing him to the Rubes at the county
fairs.</p>

<p>"What I didn't know about snakes would
have filled a book, but when I saw this one I
knew it was a bargain. It was the blamedest
biggest snake that ever gave a wriggle, and
the only reason its owners had not made a
fortune was because it was never properly
advertised. I used to know just how much
he weighed and how long he was, but my
brain got so tired figuring up the money we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
made out of him that I've had no memory
for figures since.</p>

<p>"Well, as I said, I was pretty hard up, but
I had this sparkler left for 'fall money,' and
when I saw that snake I pushed it over my
uncle's counter." He pointed to a large
yellow diamond in his scarf, and the
Stranger tried to make a mental calculation
of a pawnbroker's valuation of it.</p>

<p>"Merritt managed to dig up some mazuma,
and we chipped in fifty apiece and became
the proud possessors of Big Pete. If
I had been wise to the business I would have
known there was something wrong to make
him sell so cheap, but we more than got our
money back out of him the first week, so we
had no kick coming. The newspaper boys
were good to us and gave us a lot of space,
and we were playing on velvet and had Pete
besides. It was such a cinch that Merritt,
who looked after the snake while I did the
spieling and sold tickets on the front, commenced
to get worried for fear we should
lose him.</p>

<p>"'Jim,' says he to me one morning when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
business was a little dull, 'I believe there's
something phony about the blame snake.
He won't eat and I've tempted him with the
best I could get. I guess I'll run down to
the Bowery and get one of those snake
sharps to come up and have a look at him; I
believe his teeth need filling.'</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 454px;"><a name="Just_two_little_red_dots_on_the_back_of_his_hand" id="Just_two_little_red_dots_on_the_back_of_his_hand"></a>

"Just two little red dots on the back of his hand."</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>"I knew he was stuck on a girl that was
doing a turn in a music hall down that way,
but business was dull, so I let him go without
raising a holler. The next day he comes
back with a jaw-carpenter who claimed he
knew all about snakes and when he gets
through looking at Pete's mouth we felt
pretty blue.</p>

<p>"'Canker!' says he. 'Your little snakelet
may live a month.'</p>

<p>"Well, that put it up to us to get busy, so
I did the spieling on the outside until my
voice gave out, and Merritt lied on the inside
until he was black in the face, telling the
Rubes about how many sheep old Pete swallowed
every week. We had a lot of rabbits
and doves with him in the cage, hopping and
flying around behind the thick glass front,
and they were real sociable with old Pete,
who never batted an eye at 'em. At the end
of the month he was looking pretty thin and
we were afraid he would peg out any day.
It was hard luck on us, for things were coming
our way and our bank rolls were getting
good and plenty thick and they were all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
'yellow boys,' from the case card to the wrapper.
Our wads grew fatter as Pete grew
thinner, and we were looking for some easy
mark to unload him onto, when one morning
Merritt comes running out, just as I was
staving off a farmer who had heard him lie
and brought around a flock of scabby sheep
to sell to us for snake food.</p>

<p>"'Jim,' he yells, grabbing me by the shoulders
and waltzing around like a whirling
dervish, 'we'll make Vanderbilt and Rockefeller
look like thirty cents; old Pete has
swallowed every blame pigeon and rabbit in
the coop.'</p>

<p>"It seemed too good to be true, but when
I went to have a look there was not a feather
nor a piece of fur to be seen and old Pete
was examining all the corners of the cage to
see that he hadn't overlooked a bit. He
looked a whole lot better already, and Merritt
and I began to discuss what we should
do with all our money.</p>

<p>"But say, there was one thing we forgot
to reckon on&mdash;the appetite he had been saving
for about a year, and although the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
money came in faster than ever, most of it
went out to the rabbit men and pigeon
fanciers.</p>

<p>"You know that when a snake swallows
an animal you can see the bulge in him
for a long time, but you couldn't see any in
old Pete. He was just the same size all the
way from his nose to the tip of his tail, for
there was no space between the animals.</p>

<p>"Things began to look pretty serious for
us, for we had used up all the available small
live stock in the surrounding country, and
the Rubes got onto the fact that we were up
against their game and raised the ante on us
for what was left. It's like taking candy
from a child to sell a gold brick to a farmer,
but he everlastingly gets back at you if you
have to buy any of his produce. Hungry
Joe and the man who invented the green-goods
game would be skinned to death if
they had to buy a dozen eggs from one of
'em.</p>

<p>"And all the time old Pete kept a constant
procession of small animals moving
down his throat, regardless of expense, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
if the supply ran short he would look at
Merritt so reproachfully that it made him
feel so bad he couldn't deliver his lecture for
sobs. He worked the pathetic on him, but
if I came around there was no 'Only three
grains of corn, mother,' expression on his
face; he would just rear up on his tail and
lambaste that glass trying to get at me. I
had been living pretty well during our prosperity
and I guess I looked good to him, so
rather than have any hard feelings about it
I stuck closer than ever to the front of the
house.</p>

<p>"We had rented a frame building in a
little town up on the Hudson and were
showing him off in good form. Business
was rushing and we had the S. R. O. sign
out all the time, but snake food was getting
scarcer than boiled lobsters during the cold
snap last winter. The show had closed up
for night and we were trying to make dents
in the front of the tavern bar with our breast
bones and laying in a stock of supplies, in
case old Pete should bite us.</p>

<p>"While we were discussing the best way<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
to stimulate the rabbit-breeding industry,
'biff&mdash;boom&mdash;bang,' went the town bell and
the barkeep commenced to peel off his coat
and get into a red flannel shirt and a fireman's
helmet. It was one of those towns
where they have a dude volunteer fire department,
which the boys all join for the
socials in the winter and to look pretty on
the annual parade day. Merritt and I didn't
hurry any; we knew that it would take some
time for the chief, who kept the town drug
store, to get into his red shirt and shiny boots
and select the bouquet to carry in the big end
of his speaking trumpet. Pretty soon, 'Always
Ready, Ever Faithful, Hose Company
Number One,' which comprised the department,
came down the street, all of the company
shouting orders through trumpets at
the two coons who were pulling the cart.</p>

<p>"Of course, we went along to see the
'Fighting the Flames' show, but say: the
joke was on us, for it was our theater which
provided it. There wasn't anything left to
burn and the hose company marched
proudly back. Poor old Pete was nothing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
but a heap of ashes and Merritt looked sorrowful.</p>

<p>"'Jim,' says he, 'let's copper the rabbit
market before they get wise.'"</p>

<p>"Did you have no insurance?" asked the
Stranger sympathetically.</p>

<p>"Not a blame cent," replied his companion
as he rose to go to bed. "But I am
making good money out of old Pete yet.
I had him stuffed and get a hundred a week
from a dime museum for him&mdash;and they
furnish the feed."</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>
<h2>THE AMOROUS BABOON</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Thanks</span> to the busy Press Agent,
the fame of Jocko the Jealous, the
amorous baboon, had preceded him
to America, and when the animals from
the Paris Hippodrome had been safely
transferred to their dens in the Arena at
Dreamland he was the center of attraction
as he limbered up his muscles in the large
monkey cage, after the cramped accommodations
of the small traveling box. He had
gained a reputation as a masher in Paris; but
never had the menagerie attendants seen
him so madly in love and so insanely jealous
as upon his first introduction to American
beauty, as exemplified by the fair woman
who stood before his cage.</p>

<p>Jocko was not the first male being who
had been fascinated by the charms of the
Prima Donna during her career; for she had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
been through the marriage ceremony so
often that she could say it backwards, never
forgetting to cross her fingers before saying,
"Until death do us part." The Proprietor
drew the Stranger's attention to the group
before the cage, a mischievous smile on his
face as he looked over the half dozen of callow
youths who are always in the train of the
Prima Donna.</p>

<p>"Watch out for squalls over there," he
said. "Jocko is affectionate now, but there
will be something doing in a few minutes."
The monkey was using all of the blandishments
known to an amorous baboon and
although the words of his soft chattering
were unintelligible, their import could not
be mistaken by a past mistress of the gentle
art of love making; but the Prima Donna
could not be beguiled into placing herself
within reach of the hairy paws. Suddenly
his mood changed, for one of her male companions
placed his hand on her arm to attract
her attention and Jocko, giving a howl
of rage, danced madly up and down on all
fours, showing a vicious set of fangs as his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
lips curled back in a hideous snarl. The bars
of his cage were strong and so close together
that he could not get out to attack his rival;
but he gathered up a mass of litter from the
floor and showered Prima Donna and callow
youth alike. His screams echoed through
the Arena and caused even the majestic lions
and the haughty tigers to look in the direction
of the cage of the despised "Bandar
Log," and made the smaller animals uneasy.
The woman who was described on the programme
as "Miss &mdash;&mdash;, Famous Society
Woman," had torn herself away from her
arduous social duties with the Four Hundred
to exhibit a troupe of leopards to a
Coney Island audience, her identity concealed
by a small black mask, and her performance
in the big cage was interrupted
by the noise; so the Proprietor thought it
time to interfere.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 650px;"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49"></a>
<img src="images/010.png" width="650" height="486" alt="" title="" />
"He smoked his cigar in the lobby like any other guest."</div>



<p>The Prima Donna laughed good-naturedly
as he helped to brush the sawdust and
litter from her dress and tactfully drew her
away, and Jocko quieted down and implored
her to return; but she was accustomed to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
gentler wooing, and refused to put her
dainty gown again in jeopardy.</p>

<p>"Jocko gave quite a performance to-night,"
said the Proprietor as he joined the
Press Agent and the Stranger at the table,
after the show. "That baboon is crazy
about women; but he hasn't the discrimination
of Consul, the most intelligent monkey
that ever lived. You may remember that he
was never quiet in his cage, but if a specially
well-dressed woman stopped in front of it he
played entirely to her and when she moved
away his eyes followed her as long as she was
in sight."</p>

<p>"There will never be another like Consul,"
said the Press Agent, shaking his head
sadly. "He made my job a sinecure, for
he was good for a column any day and a
full page on Sundays."</p>

<p>"Never until the Missing Link is discovered,"
replied the Proprietor. "I don't believe
a more human monkey will ever be
found, and I attribute his wonderful intelligence
to the fact that he associated entirely
with human beings, almost from the day of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
his birth. I got him from the captain of a
tramp steamer which traded to the West
Coast, and I paid a goodish bit of money for
him too. I have never dared to tell his early
history as it was told to me, for fear I should
be laughed at for a liar; but stranger things
happen in the animal business than ever get
into print, and if I dared risk my reputation
by telling the things which actually occur in
a menagerie, I should never need a Press
Agent; but a plausible lie is accepted where
a truth which sounds improbable is turned
down."</p>

<p>The Press Agent looked at him reproachfully,
but agreed with the proposition.</p>

<p>"Do you know, I have found that to be
true when I have visited the newspaper
offices," he said. "I have actually had to
embroider some of the accounts of things
which have happened here."</p>

<p>"I suspected it, for I didn't recognize
some of the stories when I saw them in
print," answered the Proprietor, smiling at
him approvingly. He consented to tell the
history of Consul, the famous chimpanzee,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
when the Stranger expressed his entire credulity
and the Press Agent assumed an encouraging
and sympathetic attitude.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 489px;"><a name="Jocko_giving_a_howl_of_rage_danced_madly_up_and_down" id="Jocko_giving_a_howl_of_rage_danced_madly_up_and_down"></a>
<img src="images/011.png" width="489" height="500" alt="" title="" />
"Jocko, giving a howl of rage, danced madly up and down."</div>



<p>"Of course, I have to take the ship captain's
word for what happened before I
bought him, but from the way the chimp developed
and the intelligence he displayed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
after he came into my possession, I am prepared
to believe it. He told me that he got
him from the natives at the mouth of a small
river on the West Coast, where he anchored
his steamer to trade. They came off about
the ship in their canoes, but he did not care
for the rubber and ivory they had to offer
and he was about to hoist anchor when one
of them, who was in a small canoe with a
woman, motioned to him to stop. The woman
was crouched up in the stern, nursing
what the captain thought was a baby, but
when the man dragged it away from her, in
spite of her voluble protest, he saw that it
was a small chimpanzee. The man seemed
desperately anxious to trade&mdash;and I imagine
the captain's trade goods were not the
sort to meet the entire approval of the missionaries&mdash;so
that a bargain was concluded
and the woman's grief allayed by a generous
share of the purchase price. As nearly as he
could make out, she had found the little
thing in the jungle when it was only a few
days old and had reared it in place of a baby
which had just died. She was a low type of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
woman, even for an African savage, but the
maternal instinct was strong enough to
make her grieve for little Consul, as the
captain christened him. The monkey
grieved over the separation, too, but sailors
make much of animals and he soon became
reconciled to it.</p>

<p>"Thousands of people saw him after I
purchased him, and you can judge of the
reputation he attained when I tell you that
I was getting fifteen hundred dollars a week
for him in Berlin when he died, and he was
booked for the entire season at that price.
People had seen him eat with a knife and
fork, smoke a cigar, use a typewriter and do
all of the stunts which simply aped humanity,
but you had to live with the little
beast to appreciate how intensely human he
was. Everybody connected with the show
loved him, and when I wanted to find any
one of the employees who was off duty, or
not in his proper place, I always went first to
Consul's cage and I was pretty sure to locate
him. That monkey was never still, and the
things he would do and the pranks he would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
play off his own bat were more amusing
than any of the things he had been taught.</p>

<p>"When he was in company he was as well
mannered as most men, but, of course, he
had his prejudices and had to be watched.
His special aversion was a negro, which is
strange when you consider his early associations,
and if one came around when he was
loose he was apt to attack him. We had to
consider that in traveling, for Consul always
stopped at the hotels with his trainer and sat
about the lobbies, smoking his cigar like any
other guest, but if there were negro servants
about, we had to be very careful not to let
them come near him.</p>

<p>"He had the reasoning power of a child
of ten years old; he was patient when anything
was wrong and we had to do disagreeable
things to him, appreciating that it was
for his benefit. Only once did we have to use
force, when it was necessary to pull a tooth,
and I am glad it wasn't oftener, for it took
seven men to control him and they thought
they had done a day's work when we finished.
The last time he went abroad he was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
the life of the ship, but he pretty nearly
killed himself. The doctor prescribed a
cough medicine for him and Consul liked it
so well that he got up in the night, after his
trainer had gone to sleep, opened the valise
in which it was kept and emptied the bottle.
I guess there must have been laudanum in it,
for they had to work over him the rest of the
night to save him.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 531px;"><a name="All_of_his_savage_instincts_were_aroused" id="All_of_his_savage_instincts_were_aroused"></a>
<img src="images/012.png" width="531" height="500" alt="" title="" />
"All of his savage instincts were aroused."</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>"He would walk the deck with the lady
passengers, who made a great deal of him,
and when the customary concert was given,
nothing would do but that he must perform
and then pass the plate for the collection.
He was in evening dress and behaved like a
perfect gentleman, and the collection was a
large one. It was heaped on the plate, and he
was just about to present it to the captain
when Booker Washington stepped forward
to make a contribution. The money for the
Seaman's Home went flying to the four corners
of the salon and the trainer had a difficult
time in persuading Consul to retire
without tearing the clothes off of the man
whose only offense was his color. This was
Consul's last voyage, for he contracted pleurisy
and died in Berlin, and I felt worse over
his death than I did over the burning of my
whole menagerie in Baltimore a few years
ago."</p>

<p>"Have you found that early association
with human beings makes the other animals
easier to train?" asked the Stranger, and the
Proprietor shook his head.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>"No; I would rather train one taken in the
jungle than an animal born in captivity.
They do raise the pumas in South America
and have them about the houses as we do
cats; but I wouldn't trust one of 'em. And
as for the bigger cats, the lions and tigers,
there is no such thing as taming them. They
may be trained to do certain things, but they
are never trustworthy. We had a queer
illustration of that when I was traveling
with a caravan circus in France. One of the
lionesses had a litter of three cubs, and in the
excitement of the moving and strange surroundings,
she killed two of them. We took
the other one away and the woman who
cooked for us volunteered to raise it. She
became very much attached to it and developed
the theory that she could overcome its
savage instincts by diet, and for a time it
looked as if she were right. The beast was
with her for about two years and grew to a
fine animal, but she never let him taste raw
food. One day, when he was comfortably
lying before the stove, she pushed him with
her foot to get him out of the way and he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
resented it. Whether it was that alone, or
whether the odor of meat which she was
about to cook appealed to him, I don't know;
but all of his savage instincts were aroused
and when we secured him we found that he
had taken most of her scalp off."</p>

<p>"It's funny how some people are always
looking for a chance to get damages," said
the Press Agent, settling himself comfortably
in his chair. "We had a case of it when
Merritt and I were running a dime museum
out West. The freaks all lived together at
a large boarding house and one morning,
when they reported for duty, the 'Tattooed
Lady' was missing. It was before the days
when they were so common and we had spent
a lot of money to have her decorated and
made her our star attraction. Of course,
none of the tattooing was visible when she
was in street costume, but when she sat on
the platform dressed in low neck and short
skirts the lecturer had something to talk
about, for the menagerie pictured on her
was a thing of beauty, and the few choice
texts like, 'Be good and you will be happy,'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
which were scattered in between the animals,
were highly moral and elevating, and that
was one of the strong points of our show.
Merritt used to spread himself when he was
telling how she was shipwrecked on a desert
island and held captive by the cruel cannibals,
whose high priests spared her from the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
menu to tattoo her with the symbols of their
heathenish worship. It gave him a great
chance to come in strong on the moral part,
when he explained about the texts and told
how they were added after the cannibals had
been converted to red flannel shirts, silk hats
and a vegetable diet, by the missionaries, and
I have seen ancient maiden ladies moved to
tears by his recital. So when he had to give
his lecture without her, he got mixed up and
called attention to the marvelous growth of
hair on the face of the 'Circassian Beauty,'
thinking she was the 'Bearded Lady,' and
nearly pulled the ears off of the 'Dog Faced
Boy,' trying to explain that he was 'The
Man With The Rubber Skin.' Of course,
that made trouble among the freaks, who
are a mighty touchy lot anyway, and I have
noticed that trouble always comes in bunches
in the show business, so I wasn't surprised
when a husky guy that looked like a farmer
came in with blood in his eye and asked for
the manager. I looked around for Merritt,
but he had gone around the corner
to get something to drown his sorrow, so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
I slipped a piece of lead pipe under my
coat and acknowledged the soft impeachment.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 540px;"><a name="A_Tattooed_Lady_and_shes_all_covered_with_picters" id="A_Tattooed_Lady_and_shes_all_covered_with_picters"></a>
<img src="images/013.png" width="540" height="500" alt="" title="" />
"A 'Tattooed Lady,' and she's all covered with picters."</div>



<p>"'Look'ee here, wot kinder a skin game
be youse fellers runnin' here?' says the guy,
and I took a good grip on the lead pipe and
tried to turn away wrath by a soft answer,
and quoting from our advertisement that it
was a highly moral and intellectual entertainment.</p>

<p>"'Not by a dern sight, it ain't,' says he.
'It's a blasted man-trap to ketch the unwary,
an' I'll have the law on ye an' make yer pay
fer trifling with my young affections.' I
have had some pretty tough things said to
me in my day, but that was about the worst
ever, and pretty nearly took my breath
away, but he went right on.</p>

<p>"'I deliver milk to that boardin' house
down the street an' I see a likely lookin' gal
there lately an' I wanted some one to help
milk an' look after the house, so I asks her
to marry me. She says she will, so we
hitched up an' I never knew she was one o'
yer dern freaks until it was too late. She<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
says she's a "Tattooed Lady," an' she's all
covered with picters.'</p>

<p>"'Well, what's the matter with 'em?' says
I. 'Aren't they good pictures?'</p>

<p>"'Good enough,' says he, 'for them as
likes 'em; but I don't hanker after no decorations
o' that kind an', b'gosh, I'll make yer
pay fer palmin' off a damaged article on me.
She's all over snakes an' other beasts an' it
makes me sick ter my stummick every time I
thinks of 'em.' I tried to convince him that
we were not responsible and that it was his
wife's duty to have informed him.</p>

<p>"'That's what I told her, dod gast her!
But she says it's my own fault if I didn't
know she was a "Tattooed Lady," because I
never asked her, an' blamed if she isn't
proud o' them picters, too.'"</p>

<p>"How did you settle it&mdash;did he get damages?"
asked the Stranger.</p>

<p>"Damages!" exclaimed the Press Agent
as he wiped the foam from his moustache.
"Why, Merritt came in, and when he heard
the guy's kick he lit right into him.</p>

<p>"'Blame your skin!' he yelled. 'I've a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
good mind to have you arrested for stealing
the pictures from my art gallery. I have
a claim on 'em, for I paid for the liquor to
keep a sailor drunk for six weeks while he
was doing that job.' The Rube got onto the
fact that she was valuable, so they adjourned
to a saloon to talk it over."</p>

<p>"With what result?" asked the Proprietor,
as he rose from the table.</p>

<p>"Well, Merritt got her back on the platform,
the Rube sold his farm, and within
six weeks he was wearing more yellow diamonds
and throwing a bigger chest than the
husband of a grand opera prima donna."</p>

<h2>FEEDING THE SERPENTS<br />
AND<br />
A GRAND TRANSFORMATION</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">The</span> animals had received their evening
meal when the Proprietor came
from the Arena and joined the
Stranger and the Press Agent at the table
outside.</p>

<p>"I can never understand the interest people
take in seeing the carnivorous animals
fed; it is no more than giving a bone to a
dog," he said, as he took his seat. "And yet
it is one of the best drawing features of the
show, and the same people remain night
after night to see the meat poked into the
cages. If it were not for the prohibition of
the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals I could give a feeding exhibition
which would be novel and interesting, for
comparatively few people have ever seen a
snake eat.</p>

<p>"It is because a snake will not eat unless<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
it kills its own food," he continued in answer
to a question from the Stranger. "Snakes
are more particular feeders than any other
animals, and they will not touch anything
which is not alive when it is brought to them.
This is the night for feeding them, and if
you care to remain until the crowd has gone
you can see how it is done. Long as I have
been in the business, I learn something new
every day, and I never saw a cobra fed artificially
until last week, when Brandu, my
Hindoo snake charmer, received one direct
from India. It seems that they are cannibal
snakes and live upon their own kind in India,
but that would be too expensive a diet here,
and he forces feed down its throat."</p>

<p>The thousands of incandescent lights on
the Dreamland tower went out&mdash;the signal
that the barkers might cease from barking
and the spielers spiel no more&mdash;until the
morrow brought its fresh crowd of amusement
seekers, and the Proprietor led the way
into the Arena. Brandu and his two native
assistants were carrying the boxes which
contained the snakes into the big exhibition<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
cage, and, when the three men joined them,
the weirdness of the surroundings made a
profound impression upon the Stranger.
All of the lights in the Arena were extinguished,
with the exception of the small
cluster directly over their heads, and pairs of
luminous spots from the great semicircle of
cages at the outer edge of the building reminded
him that the human beings in the
cage were not the only interested spectators
of the proceedings.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 649px;"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71"></a>
<img src="images/014.png" width="649" height="401" alt="" title="" />
"A procession of sandwich men."</div>



<p>The assistants carefully removed the
great boas and pythons from the boxes, laying
them on the floor, where they crawled
lazily about, their delicate forked tongues
vibrating like streaks of red flame, while
Brandu removed a slat from a crate of rabbits
and put a half-dozen of them on the
floor. The little animals had no instinctive
fear of the serpents, for they hopped about
among them and over their wriggling bodies
unconcernedly, but the snakes were hungry
after a fast of two weeks and they wasted
no time in getting to the business before
them. The proceeding was the same in each<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
case. A serpent would crawl up to the rabbit
and place its nose, at which the little
furry beast would sniff curiously, close to
that of its prospective supper. The red
forked tongue would pass rapidly over its
face and the rabbit made no attempt to
move. Whether it was the effect of some
an&aelig;sthetic quality in the breath of the snake
or the traditional charm of the serpent, it
was hard to say, but the rabbit made no
move to escape. Slowly but surely it yielded
to the fascination of the snake, the large
transparent ears dropped to the side of the
head and the body muscles relaxed until the
tickling of the serpent's tongue caused no
reflex movement of the paws.</p>

<p>The snake then carefully withdrew its
head until the slim neck was in the form of
a letter S, and when it again straightened
out it was with the force of a released steel
spring and the aim of the flat head was unerring.
The stroke was so rapid that it was
difficult for the eye to follow and the rabbit
never knew what happened, for its body
made a quick circle in the air and in less than<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
a second all that was to be seen was one small
paw protruding from the coiled body which
had brought it a quick and merciful death.
The jaws of the serpent have seized it by the
snout and thrown it back into its coils and
the first pressure kills it, although the ever
tightening embrace continues until the bones
are crushed within the unbroken skin, so that
it can be easily swallowed.</p>

<p>It is not swallowing in the ordinary sense
of the word, for the snakes pull themselves
over the rabbits as a glove is pulled over the
finger, and the progress to the stomach can
be watched through the length of the
snake's neck. The snakes which were too
small to manage a rabbit were fed on white
rats and mice, but the process was the same
in each case, except that the Hindoos held
the rodents by their tails until the snakes
had hypnotized them.</p>

<p>"I suppose that this seems cruel to people
because the rabbits are such harmless little
beasts," said the Proprietor as the last bit
of fur disappeared. "To my mind it is not
half so cruel as hunting hares with guns and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
dogs, for death from the snake's blow is as
quick and painless as that from a bullet, and
there are no maimed and wounded animals
to drag themselves away to lingering deaths
in hiding. But now I will show you something
which has never been known in this
country."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 328px;"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75"></a>
<img src="images/015.png" width="328" height="500" alt="" title="" />
"Brought the head of the cobra close to his face."</div>



<p>One of the natives brought out a curiously
woven circular basket which he handled
with great care, and setting it in the
middle of the cage retired to a respectful
distance. Brandu crouched on the floor beside
it, and, although the performance was
not accompanied by the weird Oriental
music which signaled the public appearances
of the snake charmer, the tense expression
of his face and the uncanniness of the surroundings
made it sufficiently impressive,
for he was about to handle the cobra de
capello, the most venomous snake in all the
great collection. He wasted no time in the
pantomime and incantation of the ring performance,
but quickly threw off the cover,
and when the hooded head arose swaying
above the edge of the basket, he started a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
low whistling and passed his slim brown
hands with lightning rapidity above it. He
was absolutely fearless, but the task before
him demanded the concentration of all his
thoughts and he seemed unconscious of the
startling interruption of a fight between
two of the lions, and the shouts and pistol-shots
of the keepers who separated them.</p>

<p>He never removed his gaze from the head
of the serpent and his hands moved so rapidly
that they were almost invisible until,
quicker than a snake could strike, one of
them darted down and caught the slim neck
behind the distended hood. He gave a
sharp exclamation of triumph and sprang
to his feet, the cobra coiling its body about
his bare brown arm and giving every indication
of rage.</p>

<p>"I am always glad when that part of the
performance is over," said the Proprietor
with a sigh of relief. "Of course, it is all in
the day's work with Brandu and he has done
it thousands of times, but some day he will
be a fraction of a second too slow and then&mdash;well,
I shall have to get another snake<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
charmer. Watch him now and you will see
something which only the men of his caste
can do."</p>

<p>Brandu's white teeth glistened as he
smiled at the Proprietor and pointed first to
his own eyes and then to those of the serpent.
He brought the head of the cobra
close to his face, his expression became fixed
and stern and the pupils of his widely
opened eyes, which had been dilated until
the iris was but a narrow rim, contracted to
the size of pin heads. The cobra gazed at
him fixedly and the tense body slowly uncoiled
from his arm and hung limp and motionless,
and Brandu laid it on the floor as
lifeless and inert as a piece of rope. One of
his assistants handed him a glass containing
a couple of raw eggs and, handling it as
carelessly as if it were a harmless garter
snake, he picked up the cobra and forced a
tube of polished bamboo between its jaws.
When he had poured the eggs through the
tube he withdrew it and carefully replaced
the snake in the basket, still apparently lifeless;
but bending over he blew sharply into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
its face and the cobra was instantly reanimated
into five feet of viciousness. Its head
reared up above the edge, the spectacled
hood distended in anger, but Brandu
quickly clapped on the cover and the snake
feeding was finished for two weeks.</p>



<div class="figcenter" style="width: 303px;"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79"></a>
<img src="images/016.png" width="303" height="500" alt="" title="" />
"You're a blame fine figure of a fat man."</div>



<p>"That is a great performance of Brandu's,"
said the Press Agent, "but it profits
us nothing because the best part of it cannot
be shown to the public. I never see a
snake fed without thinking of something
which happened when I was running a side
show with the Greatest Show on Earth.</p>

<p>"You know that the dime museum business
was run to death while the craze lasted
in this country, and freaks got so common
that you couldn't throw a stone in the streets
of any large city without hitting one of 'em.
When the fickle public tired of giving up
its dimes to see 'em, a guy named Merritt
and myself had a choice collection on hand,
and we went on the road with the big show
for the summer, thinking perhaps our business
would pick up in the fall. Our two
great attractions were the biggest boa-constrictor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
in captivity, which we called 'Jointless
Jake,' and the heaviest fat man in the
world. That snake was about two hundred
feet long, and while the fat man wasn't
much on length, he held the record for belt
measurement. Nine hundred and twenty-seven
pounds he weighed, as we demonstrated
on our own scales at every performance.
Their feed bill was quite an item, as
the snake took a half-dozen sheep every two
weeks and the fat man, who was billed as
'Signor Adipose Avoirdupois'&mdash;Merritt invented
that&mdash;needed about a side of beef
every day.</p>

<p>"Freaks are a jealous lot and as hard to
manage as rival prima donnas, and these
two monstrosities came to hate each other
like poison. They were in different lines,
but you may have noticed that the side show
'professor' uses up most of the superlatives
in the English language when he gives his
lecture, and each of 'em seemed afraid that
the other would get some of his share of the
dictionary. Adipose used to look at Jake's
coiled body as if he would like to sit on it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
and flatten it out, and the snake would return
the glance with a naughty little twinkle
in its eye, as if he was estimating how much
it would have to stretch its skin to accommodate
A. A. in its interior, until it made Merritt
anxious about 'em.</p>

<p>"'That blame fat fool will waste away
and spoil his shape, if he don't stop worrying,'
he says, and he cuts a lot of his talk out
of the description of the snake and uses the
words on Adipose. Maybe you think
snakes are stupid, but they aren't, and the
boa got the hump and refused to uncoil himself
to show his length unless he got his full
share of the spiel. It cheered Avoirdupois
up, though, and when we moved to the next
town he stood around to gloat over Jake
when he was being moved from the traveling
box to the exhibition cage. The snake
hadn't been fed for ten days and he was
good and lively as well as being out of temper,
so when he caught sight of the Signor
he scattered the boys with one flip of his
tail and went for him.</p>

<p>"I've heard of bear hugs, but I never saw<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
such a squeezing as that boa gave poor Adipose.
It was a long way around him, but
the snake made about a dozen wraps and all
we could see of the fat man was a pair of
feet sticking out at one end of the coil and
his face, which looked like a purple harvest
moon, projecting from the other. Jake
reaches out and gets hold of a tent peg with
his tail, which gives him a purchase, and then
he tightens up for fair and Adipose lets out
a holler you could hear a mile.</p>

<p>"Of course, we got busy with crowbars
and jackscrews and tried to pry Jake off,
but there was nothing doing and the harder
we pried the closer he cinched up on Adipose.
Merritt usually had a suggestion to
make, so I looked at him and he was lost in
thought, but in a minute he brightens up
and calls for a rope.</p>

<p>"'We can't pry the blame snake away
from the man,' says he, as he tied the rope
around the Signor's feet, 'so we'll try to
pull the man away from the snake.' All
hands fell to and pulled to beat four of
a kind, but Jake just tightened up a bit<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
and grinned and Adipose let out another
holler.</p>

<p>"'You need a traction engine on that
rope,' says I when they gave it up as a bad
job, and Merritt, who was looking a little
discouraged, gave a whoop.</p>

<p>"'Bring an elephant,' he yelled, and when
one of the boys started off on a run for the
menagerie, he called after him to 'make
that order two elephants.' The Hathis came
lumbering over, and Merritt tied the rope
around the shoulders of one and put another
rope around Jake's neck and the shoulders
of the other elephant.</p>

<p>"'Now pull, blame you!' says he, heading
'em in different directions and giving one of
'em a kick, and they put their shoulders
against the ropes. It was a mighty interesting
performance to every one but Adipose,
who didn't seem to enjoy it at all, judging
from the yells he let out. Jake was having
the time of his life, and the harder the elephants
pulled the tighter he squeezed the
Signor, and when he felt that they were getting
the better of him he made a supreme<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
effort which kinked up every muscle in his
body. But there was no holding on against
those brutes, and pretty soon the fat man
commenced to slip out from the coils, feet
first. It was a queer thing to watch and his
legs stretched so that I thought his knees
would never come into sight. His legs had
been about the size of barrels when the snake
grabbed him, but between the stretching and
the squeezing they were now three times as
long and about as large as broomsticks. He
weighed as much as ever when the elephants
finally got him out, but the flesh was distributed
differently and instead of being six
feet tall and twelve feet around, he was
twelve feet long and built in proportion.
The snake was up against it, too, for he had
cramped himself so with that last squeeze
that he couldn't straighten out the kinks,
and he kept in the same shape as when he
was wrapped around the Signor. We tried
to straighten him out, but it was no use; he
just stayed coiled up like a spring and the
boys rolled him around as if he were a
barrel.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>"Merritt had kept cheerful as long as
there was anything to be done, but tears
came to his eyes when he looked at Adipose.
The Signor was standing up, gazing at his
feet, which he hadn't seen before in twenty
years, and Merritt looked up at him and
freed his mind.</p>

<p>"'You're a blame fine figure of a fat man,
aren't you, now?' says he. 'Just on account
of your confounded professional jealousy
we lose our two star attractions, for that
blamed snake is so kinked up that he isn't
good for anything except to cut up into
barrel hoops.'</p>

<p>"The Signor was ashamed of himself and
hadn't a word to say, so he just kept quiet
and tried to get used to his new shape and
taking a bird's-eye view of things. Merritt
and I were feeling pretty blue when
along comes Tody Hamilton, the circus
press agent, and as soon as he saw what
had happened he made a run for a trolley
car.</p>

<p>"'Don't let 'em get away!' he yelled back
over his shoulder. 'This is the biggest scoop<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
on record and I'm off for the printing-office.'</p>

"Jake was having the time of his life, and the harder the elephants pulled the tighter he squeezed the Signor."</div>



<p>"'It'll make a good newspaper story, all
right; but where do we come in on it?' says
Merritt, looking mournfully at Adipose.</p>

<p>"Well, a couple of hours later I had to go
into the city to order some new togs for the
Signor, who looked as if he were dressed in
a particularly baggy bathing suit since he
had been stretched out, and the first thing
I saw was a procession of sandwich men
marching down the street. The ink wasn't
dry on the posters, but Tody had been busy,
and there in flaming red letters was the announcement&mdash;</p>

<h2>THE LIONESS SKIRT DANCE<br />
AND THE<br />
INCONSIDERATE PYTHON</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">The</span> conventional skirt dance has long
ceased to be a novelty on the vaudeville
stage, but as it is performed by
"La Belle Selica" in the Arena at Dreamland
it holds the interest of that most
exacting audience&mdash;a crowd of Coney
Island pleasure seekers. It is not because
Selica is pre-eminent among dancers, but on
account of the unusual and dangerous stage
setting; for she performs in the large exhibition
cage, surrounded by a half dozen lionesses,
each animal seated on a separate pedestal.
Any one of the huge beasts could
crush the dancer with a single blow of a
massive paw, and the great jaws which snap
viciously at her tiny feet as she kicks them
before their faces are sufficiently powerful
to crush the shin-bone of an ox.</p>

<p>She is apparently without fear of them,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
for she dances gracefully from one to the
other, flicking them across their faces with
the light switch which she carries for her
only protection, and kicking over their
heads and into their very mouths, always
missing the answering snap of the jaws by
the fraction of an inch, and acknowledging
it with a smile as she whirls away to repeat
the performance before another pedestal.
The lionesses see the performance many
times in the course of a season, but they
never lose interest in it and they do not remove
their eyes from Selica from the time
she enters the cage until she drives them out
before her. So long as she is on her feet and
agile enough to escape the swift stroke of a
paw or the snapping jaws, she is safe; for
a lioness would not jump at her from a
pedestal; but there is always the chance of a
slip or a false step and then&mdash;&mdash;!!!</p>

<p>It happened once, and caused a suspension
of Selica's performance for two months
during the Pan-American Exposition at
Buffalo, for Grace, the largest lioness, was
on her before she could recover herself; and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
it required the efforts of Bostock and all of
his trainers to beat back the beasts who were
maddened by the sight and smell of blood
and to rescue the unconscious woman from
the cage. They have never forgotten that
moment of rebellion which was so nearly
successful, and they are ever watchful for
another opportunity to avenge the many<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
cuts of the training whip which they received
in the course of their schooling. But
Selica is also watchful, and although Grace
had latterly done nothing particularly out
of the way, the wonderful sixth sense which
experienced trainers always acquire warned
her that the animal should be regarded with
suspicion. The beast had become nervous;
a little more sullen than usual when ordered
to leave her den for the exhibition cage, and
a trifle slow and rebellious when told to
jump up on her allotted pedestal.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 583px;"><a name="Now_if_youll_kindly_give_me_your_attention" id="Now_if_youll_kindly_give_me_your_attention"></a>
<img src="images/018.png" width="583" height="500" alt="" title="" />
"Now, if you'll kindly give me your attention."</div>



<p>Constant association with the wild animals
begets carelessness but Selica, with the
scars of Grace's sharp claws still visible on
her back and shoulders, was quick to notice
the change and especially careful, before
opening the door from the den to the runway,
to look through the observation hole
and make sure that the lioness was not
crouched for a spring. Grace had been particularly
sullen in the afternoon and she was
growling ominously when Selica went to
get her for the evening performance, but
when the woman saw the three little furry<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
balls which were huddled in a corner of the
den she understood and forgave all. The
cubs were no larger than St. Bernard puppies,
but Grace apparently considered them
worth fighting for; and Selica's dance was
given that night with only five lionesses in
the cage, and the Proprietor told the
Stranger the reason for the empty pedestal.</p>

<p>"Wait until after the performance and I
will take them out of the cage and show
them to you," he said; and the Stranger, remembering
a tradition to the effect that
robbing a lioness of her cubs is a dangerous
feat, looked forward with a great deal of
interest to the after-piece.</p>

<p>"We can't trust the rearing of the cubs to
Grace," said the Proprietor, as he stood in
front of her cage after the audience had
been dismissed. "The close proximity of
the other animals in the Arena and the curiosity
of the thousands of people who come
here every day would make her so crazy that
she would destroy them, so I must get them
a foster mother. I have sent to New York
for a bitch with pups, and in a couple of days<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
I will show you a happy family." The cubs
were in the center of the cage and Grace
stood over them, snarling and looking with
blazing eyes at the group in front of it; but
Selica's voice from the runway and a rattling
of the door at the back distracted her
attention, and as she sprang at the door the
Proprietor darted a hand between the bars
and seized one of the cubs, drawing it safely
out a half second before the enraged mother
landed against the bars with a force which
made them rattle.</p>

<p>The poor beast was almost frantic, but
the same maneuver was twice repeated, and
in spite of her fierce attacks on doors and
bars the Proprietor, who had acquired
through his lifetime association with the
great cats as much of their quickness of
movement as it is given to mere man to
learn, removed the three cubs without receiving
a scratch.</p>

<p>Poor helpless little creatures they were,
and it was difficult to realize that they would
soon grow into beasts as powerful as the
ferocious Baltimore, the terror of trainers,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
who was answering Grace's lamentations
with roars which fairly shook the building,
from his cage on the other side of the
Arena.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 410px;"><a name="Looked_like_the_pennant_of_a_man-o-war" id="Looked_like_the_pennant_of_a_man-o-war"></a>
<img src="images/019.png" width="410" height="500" alt="" title="" />
"Looked like the pennant of a man-o'-war."</div>



<p>"That animal was bred in captivity, born
and raised in our menagerie in England,"
said the Proprietor after he had placed the
cubs in charge of one of the keepers. "I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
suppose that's what makes him such a bad
beggar to handle. Give me the jungle-bred
lion to train, every time, for after the manhandling
and discomfort of his capture and
transportation to the coast by the natives,
he appreciates the care and humanity of a
civilized trainer. These cubs which are
raised in captivity are always played with
and teased by the employees and visitors,
and their first knowledge of their strength
comes to them accidentally when they hurt
a man without meaning to do it; but they
soon learn to connect cause and effect, and
then it is time to watch out for 'em. A
jungle-bred lion is pretty much cock o' the
walk until he is snared or trapped, and in his
first experience with men he is vanquished
and realizes how useless is his great strength
against the nets and ropes which entangle
him. The cub born in captivity is familiar
with men from the first, and plays with them
like a kitten until one day he is out of sorts
or is accidentally hurt in a frolic and the
swift cut of his razor-like claws makes his
playmate or tormentor drop him and leave<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
him in peace. That makes it hard for the
trainer when he takes him in hand, for although
the cub may be subdued, he remembers
that he was once victorious and watches
his chance. Jack Bonavita, the greatest
trainer who ever went into a lion's cage,
would have two good arms to-day if Baltimore
had been born in the Nubian desert
instead of in Manchester."</p>

<p>They stood in front of Baltimore's cage
for a moment, admiring the swelling muscles
of the great beast as he sprang from
side to side, shaking his shaggy mane and
roaring defiance at the world, and then
turned to go to the white-topped table in
front of the Arena. In the doorway they
met the Press Agent, looking anything but
cheerful and muttering maledictions on the
heads of all city editors. The Proprietor
told him of the new arrivals in the Arena,
and suggested sending the announcement
of the birth to the papers.</p>

<p>"A fat chance I'd stand of having it
printed," he grumbled. "Here I've worked
half the season and never given 'em a story<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
that wasn't pretty nearly true, and to-day
when I take them that account of Morelli
and the jaguar they turn me down and
holler 'fake.' Let me take one of those cubs
and stripe it over with a little black paint,
and to-morrow morning every newspaper in
New York will have a photographer down
here to take pictures of 'the only hybrid
lion-tiger cub ever born,' and all of the space
jerkers will be buttonholing me for a three
column, front page story."</p>

<p>The arrival of the waiter with soothing
beverages soon brought back the customary
smile to his genial face and the Proprietor's
suggestion that perhaps he had embroidered
some of the stories just a trifle, aroused only
a good-natured protest.</p>

<p>"The worst thing about the press agent's
profession is that he has to risk his eternal
salvation by making up plausible lies to satisfy
the newspapers when he could give 'em
better stories which are actually true if they
would take 'em on his say so," he said, as he
wiped the froth from his mustache. "I remember
once when a guy named Merritt<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
and myself were running a snake show in
New York that we couldn't pay the rent
because the papers wouldn't give us any
publicity, although we had the finest collection
of wrigglers that was ever gotten together.
We were running it on the dead
level, nary a fake about it, and Merritt's lecture
was highly instructive and interesting
and more than half true; but we saw that
we couldn't win out at the game unless we
crooked it. We were running so far behind
that the only thing which saved us from a
dispossess was the fact that they couldn't
get a constable who would carry the snakes
out to the sidewalk; but Merritt was a resourceful
cuss and I felt confident that he
would figure out some scheme to win out.</p>



<div class="figcenter" style="width: 428px;"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101"></a>
<img src="images/020.png" width="428" height="500" alt="" title="" />
"Kicking over their heads and into their very mouths."</div>



<p>"'Jim,' says he, 'it's necessary for us to
give 'em a sensation. We've tried to run
this game as a purely moral and instructive
entertainment, but we need the money and
I reckon we've got to spring a cold deck on
'em. I guess you've got to stand for being
attacked by an untamable, man-eating
python.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>"'You can count me out on that,' says I.
'Every paper in the city would write me up
as a victim of the demon Rum.' Merritt
looked discouraged for a minute, but his
face suddenly lighted up and I knew he had
found a way.</p>

<p>"'Jim,' says he, 'if we only take half of
our usual allowance of fire-water to-night
we will have enough cash to buy some paint.
Now there's that big white python; the only
specimen ever captured, the "pythonatus
fluidum lactalis giganticus,"' says he. That
was one trouble with Merritt; he'd get so
stuck on the language which he manufactured
that he couldn't leave it out, even in
our business consultations, and it used up
a lot of time. 'That python is the straight
goods,' says he, 'but he doesn't catch their
eyes, so I'll paint the blame snake red, white
and blue and christen him the "anacondus
flagelum americanibus e pluribus unum,"
and give the reporters something to work
on,' says he. 'That'll work up the snakologists
and set 'em writing in the papers to
prove that there isn't any such thing; but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
we've got the answer to that, for we can
show 'em one at twenty-five cents per.'</p>

<p>"I never could stand for flim-flamming
the generous public, but my meal ticket was
punched so full of holes that it looked like
a porous plaster, and I consented. Merritt
spent most of the night decorating that
python, and in the morning it looked like
the pennant of a man-o'-war. I had to sit
up and watch him, for he had the artistic
temperament, and he was so carried away by
his enthusiasm that if I hadn't restrained
him he would have put on the coat-of-arms
of the United States, eagle, motto and all.</p>

<p>"'Now,' says he, when he had finished and
stepped back to admire his work, 'if that
blame snake's own mother would know him
if she met him on the street, I'm a Dutchman.
If this don't make 'em sit up and take
notice, then I'll go to night school to learn
the show business.'"</p>

<p>"How did the scheme work?" asked the
Proprietor, as the Press Agent paused to
make the grand hailing sign of distress to
the waiter.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>"Work!" he answered. "How does a
fake always work in New York? Why,
P. T. Barnum had the mold for his petrified
man made from the legs of one man and the
body of another, and he didn't even take the
trouble to smooth off the ridges where the
edges met when he cast it in Portland
cement. But that didn't prevent all of the
scientific sharps who inspected it from certifying
to its genuineness. His mermaid was
manufactured from a codfish skin and a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
stuffed monkey; but the public stood for
that, too, and he made a fortune out of 'em.
Maybe you can't fool all of the people all of
the time, but you can fool most of 'em most
of the time; especially if they live in little
old New York. Of course, we didn't pull
off such a success as Barnum did; but we
had no kick coming when we counted up the
receipts for the next week. Merritt's lecture
was a work of art and he manufactured
language at a rate which would have given
Noah Webster nervous prostration when he
christened the python 'Old Glory,' and told
about its combining the venomous qualities
of the cobra and the strength of the boa-constrictor.
The python was so stuck on
its new colors that it nearly broke its neck
turning around to admire itself and everything
went lovely. Of course, there was the
usual howl from the snakologists who knew
it all, and 'Old Subscriber,' 'Citizen,' 'Pro
Bono Publico' and the rest of the bunch
wrote columns to the newspapers, denouncing
us as frauds.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 530px;"><a name="Grace_snarled_over_the_cubs" id="Grace_snarled_over_the_cubs"></a>

Grace snarled over the cubs.</div>

<p>"You know how those things work;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
everybody puts up an argument and then
it's up to the fellow who is making the bluff
to back it up with an offer to donate a sum
of money to some charitable institution if
he can't deliver the goods. We were well
ahead of the game as a result of the advertising
and had about two thousand to the
good and Merritt got awful chesty. He
had lied about that snake so much that he
believed in it himself and it made me a little
nervous one night when he offered to donate
two thousand dollars to the 'Home for Decrepit
Side Show Fakirs' if any one could
produce another specimen like this one,
short of the head waters of the Amazon. I
wasn't scared so much by that as by what I
feared he might say, for I knew they
couldn't get another if they raked the universe
with a fine-tooth comb, and sure
enough, he was carried away by his enthusiasm
and offered to bet our entire bank roll
that the snake was a genuine 'American
flag', such as had never been exhibited in
any country.</p>

<p>"It was just our luck that there was a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
half-loaded tin-horn gambler in the audience
that night; one of the kind that wears
a yellow diamond and a checked suit with
a white stove-pipe hat; and the only part of
the speech that he understood was that
somebody wanted to make a bet. That
raised his sporting blood, and he climbed
up to the platform and pulled out a roll of
yellow boys that would choke a dog and
peeled off twenty centuries.</p>

<p>"'I don't know much about snakes which
bromide won't make chase themselves back
to the woods,' says he as he plunked 'em
down on the table. 'I ain't got your gift of
gab, but money talks and I've got this pile
to say that you can't tell the truth to save
your neck. Just stack up your pile alongside
of that and then trot out your snakelet.'
I was feeling pretty sore on Merritt for
making such a bluff, but, of course, we had
to make good and between us we covered the
bet. We had glass cages full of snakes all
around the platform, but 'Old Glory' was
in a big chest covered with gilt figures
and brass chains and fastened with a padlock.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
Merritt was mad clear through at
having his veracity questioned, but he looked
pretty confident as he stuck the key in the
lock.</p>

<p>"'It's a shame to take the money,' says he,
as he eyed the gambler, 'but there's an old
saying about the mental capacity of a man
that is speedily separated from his bank roll,
and I reckon you were away from home the
last time the fool killer called.' The gam
just smiled and kept his eye on the stakes,
and Merritt gives the chains a rattle to wake
up 'Old Glory' and throws back the lid of
the chest.</p>

<p>"'Now,' says he, turning to the audience,
'if you'll kindly give me your attention I'll
show you one of the most marvelous mysteries
of Nature. It was procured by one
of our special agents at the head waters of
the Amazon at tremendous expense. It is
a unique representative of the reptilian
family and the sight of it should arouse
pride in the hearts of all patriotic Americans;
for as he unwinds his sinuous coils you
will observe that while his head and neck<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
are blue, the body, down to the tip of the
tail, is marked with thirteen alternate stripes
of red and white, giving this marvelous creature
the appearance of being wrapped in
that glorious emblem of liberty which waves
over the land of the brave and the home of
the free.' Merritt stops then, throwing out
his chest and sticking his hand into the
bosom of his coat to wait for the customary
applause from the gallery to subside; but
instead of the usual glad hands he was
greeted with a roar of laughter and cat-calls
and when he turned to look at the
snake box, there was 'Old Glory' crawling
out, looking ashamed of himself, for he was
as white as the day he was born."</p>

<p>"What happened?" asked the Proprietor
as the Press Agent sighed.</p>

<p>"Well, Merritt always had presence of
mind, and as the sport gathered up our hard
earned shekels he grabbed me by the arm
and hurried me from the building. He
knew that a Bowery audience was apt to
follow cat-calls with antique eggs and vegetables
of last season's vintage, and five minutes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
later we were trying to drown our
sorrow.</p>

<p>"'Jim,' says Merritt, 'I made a big mistake,
for I should have tattooed him. His
beauty was only skin deep and the blame
snake shed his skin.'"</p>

THE ETERNAL FEMININE</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Uncle Sam</span> spends a large
amount of money to forecast the
weather twenty-four hours in advance,
and the farmers and seafaring
folk watch the bulletins no more eagerly
than do the owners of the many shows
whose harvest time is the brief summer
season at Coney Island. Bad weather,
especially if it comes on the first or last day
of the week or a legal holiday, means a loss
of hundreds of dollars to them, for if the
skies are threatening, the holiday makers
seek their pleasures nearer home and there
are fewer people to give up their dimes and
quarters under the seductive wheedling of
the "barkers." Most of the show people
look anxiously at the sky before retiring for
the night, but there is one of them who finds
an absolutely reliable forecast within the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
walls of his own building. Perhaps the
signs and portents could not be translated
by the weather clerk, but the Proprietor of
the trained animal exhibition at Dreamland
has been all of his life the companion of
his charges, and has learned to recognize the
meaning of unusual behavior or the shade of
change in their voices which indicates an approaching
storm.</p>

<p>There was not a cloud to be seen, and
every star in the heavens was trying to rival
the brilliant electric lights on the great
tower as he sat at the caf&eacute; table in front of
the Arena with the Stranger and the Press
Agent after the night's performance was
over, but he gave an exclamation of disappointment
as a half-smothered roar came
from the throat of one of the lions in the
building.</p>

<p>"Rain to-morrow!" he said as the grumbling
roar spread from cage to cage about
the great semicircle. His companions
smiled incredulously as they looked at the
cloudless sky, but he repeated his prediction
when the Stranger read "Fair and warmer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
to-morrow" from one of the evening papers.
"I know all about the 'high and low pressure
areas,'" he said, as he glanced at the chart.
"A man in the show business has to study
everything which may influence the attendance,
but the behavior of my animals is a
better barometer for local conditions than
any aneroid which the Weather Bureau
owns. In spite of the clear sky and the
official predictions, I would wager that we
shall have a bad storm within the next
twenty-four hours, for those lions have the
inherited knowledge of hundreds of generations
of jungle-bred ancestors whose food
supply depended largely upon the weather
conditions."</p>

<p>"Do the other animals possess the same
barometric accomplishments?" asked the
Stranger skeptically, and the Proprietor
laughed as he invited him to come inside and
judge for himself. The Arena was always
an uncanny place at night, for in the dim
light only the glowing eyes of the animals
could be distinguished in the cages, and the
snarls and growls which came from behind<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
the gratings conjured up visions of what
might happen if one of the animals were
loose and crouching on the seats of the auditorium
or in the galleries, waiting for a meal
of human flesh; but to-night it was worse
than usual, for the unwonted restlessness of
the animals was apparent even to the untrained
senses of the Stranger.</p>

<p>The carnivora in captivity retain the
habits of their relatives of the jungle and
are more alert at night than in the daytime,
but following a hard day's work in the exhibition
cage they usually settle down for a
few hours of sleep after receiving their
evening allowance of meat. Although it
was long past their resting time, not an eye
was closed, and hundreds of pairs of bright
spots were visible in the darkness as the
beasts paced uneasily from end to end of
their narrow dens. The elephants, whose
arduous duties in the ring and on the ballyhoo
brought such leg weariness that they
were usually glad to be shackled for the
night, were swaying their huge bodies from
side to side and straining at the stout chains<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
which fastened them and the shrill trumpeting
of Tom, the largest one, was echoed and
repeated by his companions, Roger and
Alice. The roaring of the lions and the
snarling of the tigers was mocked by the
hideous laugh of the hyenas, and the discord
of the strange noises was so disagreeable
that the Stranger was relieved when they
left the Arena and returned to the comparative
quiet of the white-topped table.</p>

<img src="images/022.png" width="650" height="439" alt="" title="" />
"Every one of the great beasts jumped for her."</div>



<p>"It will be a severe storm," said the Proprietor
as the waiter took their orders.
"Any impending change makes them uneasy,
but when every animal in the menagerie
is in the state of excitement which you
noticed to-night you can be assured that it
means a very decided disturbance. It is a
thing which animal trainers are ever watchful
about, for most of the training is done
at night, and it is not safe to work with them
when they are in that frame of mind."</p>

<p>"But you give your advertised performances
just the same," said the Press Agent.</p>

<p>"That's a different matter," answered the
Proprietor. "When the Arena is lighted up<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
and filled with people, the attention of the
animals is distracted and they forget their
nervousness, but a rehearsal at night is a
lonesome proceeding, at best, and as the
trainer devotes his attention to a single animal
at a time it leaves the others free to
think up mischief or to give way to their
unreasoning fear. I had that borne in upon
me in a way I shall never forget a few years
ago when I was a younger hand at the business.
I knew a good deal about handling
animals, but not as much about managing
men as I have learned since, and I used to
forget that giving an order was not the same
thing as seeing that it was executed. There
was a trainer named Barton in my employ
who did a pretty fair act with a group of six
lions, but he was a brutal sort of a chap and
punished his animals so severely that they
went through their performance on the
jump so as to get out of the exhibition cage,
where blows were more plentiful than kind
words. His act was a winner, all right, for
he was absolutely fearless and the animals
put up a bluff of snarling and snapping<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
which made it exciting, but I disliked the
man so much that I was glad to farm him
out for a ten weeks' engagement on the
vaudeville circuit.</p>

<p>"He wasn't a bad-looking chap and when
he came back from his tour he brought with
him one of the most beautiful women I have
ever seen. She was an Egyptian who had
been brought to this country with a troupe
of dancers for one of the big exhibitions, and
he met her and married her when they were
performing in the same theater. Of course,
I had absolutely no use for an Egyptian
dancer with my show and I made the marriage
an excuse to get rid of Barton; but he
begged me to keep him on the plea that he
was teaching her to do his act with the lions.
She was so beautiful that I realized that she
would be a great drawing card if she developed
into a good trainer, so I consented and
signed a contract with him for another year.
I regretted it when I saw the first rehearsal,
for it was painfully evident that she went
into the cage only because she was more
afraid of her husband than she was of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
lions, and I didn't blame her; for while I
might interfere to prevent ill-treatment of
the lions, which were my property, I had no
authority to protect her from his cruelty.
They did most of the rehearsing at night,
and I trusted to the fear which Barton had
instilled in the lions to keep them from attacking
her, for he always stood at the bars
and they would cower down at the sound of
his voice. You know it is never safe for
two people to be in the cage with a group of
animals at the same time unless they stand
back to back and keep in one place, for if
they are moving about an animal may run
into one while endeavoring to escape from
the other, and even the blow from a lion's
tail might knock a man from his feet and
then there would be trouble.</p>



<div class="figcenter" style="width: 650px;"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123"></a>
<img src="images/023.png" width="650" height="475" alt="" title="" />
"Jim," says Merritt, ... "there is a great advantage in having a squaw for the top part of that there fish."</div>



<p>"Poor little Leotta used to go into the
cage and try to keep the tell-tale tremble out
of her voice when she gave her commands,
but she could never learn to concentrate her
whole attention on the animals and give up
looking for a sign of approval from Barton
out of the corner of her eye. I made it a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
point to see that there was always plenty
of assistance near in case of accidents, and
gave Barton strict orders to keep her out of
the cage when the animals were under the
influence of 'weather fear.' It was difficult
for me to instruct or warn Leotta, for she
understood English very little; but I helped
her all I could, and gave her husband to understand
that I would not allow any ill-treatment.</p>

<p>"In spite of all my precautions, I was
always uneasy when she was in the cage, and
when I had to be away from the show she
was constantly in my mind. I had to go to
the wharf one afternoon to superintend the
unloading of a new lot of animals which had
been sent from our English quarters, and
owing to delays at the custom house it was
late at night before I could start back for
the show. Perhaps I had absorbed some of
the weather wisdom of the animals from
long association with them, but, at any rate,
I was uneasy at the delays and as I whizzed
along in the trolley I congratulated myself
on my foresight in having warned Barton,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
as the thunder heads were gathering and I
knew the animals would have the jumps and
be unsafe to work with. But my heart sank
as I drew near the building and saw that it
was brilliantly lighted up, for that could
only mean one thing at that time of night&mdash;Leotta
must be rehearsing. The trainers
usually have but one small cluster of lights,
but I had ordered the electrician to turn on
all the switches when she was in the cage,
as I thought she would be less frightened
and the animals more tractable in the full
light.</p>

<p>"My guess was right: Barton, in disobedience
of orders, had made her go into the
cage, and he had taken advantage of my
absence to break our iron-clad rule which
forbids a trainer to drink. I saw the whole
situation as soon as I entered the building,
and I would have given the whole show to
have the little woman safely on the right side
of the bars. The animals in the dens were
raising a worse row than they did to-night,
and the lions in Leotta's group had forgotten
their fear of the trainer in their greater<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
fear of the approaching storm. They were
ugly, and Barton, who was more than half-seas
over, stood at the bars shouting abuse
at his wife and the lions and jeering at her
evident terror. I saw that the other trainers
and keepers appreciated the danger, for
they were gathered around, holding iron
bars, Roman candles and pistols; but they
had sense enough to know that any interference
which would draw his attention from
the cage would precipitate the trouble, and
none of them could make Leotta appreciate
the danger of her position. I went up to
him quietly and told him that I thought he
had better call the rehearsal off for the
night, intending to square accounts with
him as soon as Leotta was safely out of the
cage; but the drink was in his brain and he
turned on me and cursed me. Leotta gave
a scream of terror as the brute turned his
back on the cage and, as if by a preconcerted
plan, every one of the six great
beasts jumped for her.</p>

<p>"Barton knew that the game was up, and
in his drunken rage he attacked me and it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
kept my hands full to manage him; but the
others rushed for the cage, and while Bonavita
and Stevenson beat off the lions with
the help of the keepers on the outside who
were firing pistols and Roman candles and
using fire-extinguishers through the bars,
Bobby Mack picked up Leotta and carried
her outside. Of course, that ended Leotta's
career in the show business and finished
Barton's employment with me. The poor
little thing's beauty was gone, for a lion's
claws make deep cuts, and it was many a
day before she was able to leave the hospital.
You can see that I have reason to be confident
of the accuracy of the predictions of
my weather bureau, for if there had been no
thunderstorm brewing I might have developed
a sensational lion act."</p>

<p>"Or if Leotta had understood English,"
commented the Press Agent, as he beckoned
to the waiter. "Of course, it is sometimes an
advantage to have performers who can't
converse with the audience, but it is mighty
inconvenient if they can't understand the
orders of the boss. I lost the chance of making<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
a lot of money once, because a squaw
who was working for us couldn't understand
the white man's lingo. A guy named
Merritt and myself were disappointed about
getting a concession for a snake show at the
Pan-American Exposition, and we found
ourselves broke in Buffalo, which is separated
from the Bowery by about five hundred
miles of very tough walking when you
haven't got the price of a railway ticket.
Merritt was mad clean through at being
thrown down by the Exposition managers,
but he was an inventive genius and I knew
that he would figure out a way to raise the
price of transportation.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 390px;"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129"></a>
<img src="images/024.png" width="390" height="500" alt="" title="" />
"A howl of terror from the platform."</div>



<p>"'Jim,' says he as we counted up our
available assets and found that they were
pretty well along toward a minus quantity,
'it makes me dead sore to be turned down
this way without getting a run for our
money, and it's up to us to increase our capital
and incidentally give the bunch that
done us dirt the double cross. Get your
think tank working and see what it will produce.'
I couldn't see a way out, but when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
a squaw from the Tonawanda Reservation,
who was selling trailing arbutus, came up
to us and offered us a nosegay, Merritt gives
a whoop and claps me on the shoulder.</p>

<p>"'Jim,' says he, 'I've got it and we'll
make our everlasting fortunes!' He commenced
to question the squaw, but all the
English she knew was 'ten cent a bunch,'
and he didn't make much headway until a
big buck Injin who had been watching her
from across the street came over and butted
in. It appeared that he was her husband,
and when Merritt stated his proposition the
buck accepted the terms without the formality
of consulting the squaw. When the
Exposition opened we had a big tent on an
open lot across from the main entrance,
with a life-sized picture of 'The Marvelous
Mermaid' as big as a house. As I remarked,
Merritt was an inventive genius and he had
worked up a scheme to deceive the confiding
public. He had provided a platform
and carefully cut out a hole so that the
squaw could stand on the ground and the
edges of the hole fitted snugly about her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
waist. He made her lean forward and rest
her chin in her hands in the conventionally
accepted mermaid position, and then he
fitted a fish tail which lay along the top of
the platform, and it was so skillfully joined
to her that it looked as if it grew there. She
was a good-looking squaw and she certainly
played her part and made an interesting picture.</p>

<p>"Of course, he couldn't explain to her
what he wanted her to do, but he would tell
the buck, who would carefully translate and
impress the instructions upon her memory
with the aid of a bale stick. The thing which
he put most stress upon was that she was to
remain absolutely still, no matter what happened.
I sold the tickets and put up the
spiel on the front, and Merritt lectured inside
and we did a land-office business. Lots
of smart guys came around and tried to get
gay with the mermaid, but she couldn't understand
their joshing and never cracked a
smile. The blame tent caught fire one night
when it was filled with people, and she had
such a wholesome recollection of the bale<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
stick that she kept as still as a cigar-store Indian
until we had cleared the place and put
the fire out.</p>

<p>"'Jim,' says Merritt as he looked her over
admiringly after that experience, 'there is a
great advantage in having a squaw for the
top part of that there fish. She can't understand
what the Willie boys say to her and
nothing feazes her. A white gal would have
had hysterics and given the whole snap
away.' It gave Merritt a lot more confidence
and we felt pretty safe after that experience,
and neglected to have the buck repeat
his bale-stick admonitions to her upon
the necessity of cultivating repose of manner.
Everything was lovely and we were
turning hundreds of people away and making
more money than the big show. One
afternoon we were playing to a record house
and Merritt was doing himself proud on his
lecture.</p>

<p>"'Ladies and gentlemen,' says he, 'I have
the honor to present to this intelligent audience
a creature which is commonly, but erroneously,
supposed to be extinct at the present<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
day; but you have before you a living and
convincing proof that mermaids still exist.
I confess that until I was able to obtain this
unique specimen, which was captured while
basking in the sun and singing a love song
upon an iceberg in the Antarctic Ocean, I
shared the opinions of my fellow scientists
that the mermaid was a fabulous or extinct
creature; for during a lifetime devoted to
exhibiting the mysterious marvels of nature
to the American public it had never been my
good fortune to acquire one. You will observe
that she is half woman and half fish,
and she is perfectly helpless when out of the
water. She is unfortunately unable to express
herself in any known tongue; in fact,
she has never uttered a sound since her capture
and we fear that she has lost her voice,
which&mdash;' Just then he was interrupted by a
howl of terror from the platform, which was
followed by a roar of laughter from the
audience, and when he turned he saw the
squaw standing up and trying to wrap the
fake tail around a pair of well-developed,
copper-colored legs. Her face was as pale<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
as a squaw's face could get and Merritt
knew the jig was up. I was peeking in the
door, and when I saw what had happened I
gathered up the box-office receipts and
faded away. I met Merritt that evening in
our usual saloon, and underneath a pair of
black eyes and a battered-up phiz I could
see that he was wearing a look of deep disgust.</p>

<p>"'Jim,' says he, 'this is what comes from
pinning your faith to a woman and not appreciating
the weakness of the sex. She
faced the danger of being burned alive and
never turned a hair; but when she saw a
measly little mouse crawl under the platform
she busted up the whole show.'"</p>

<p>The Stranger said good-night and started
for the city, but before he reached the railway
station he was drenched by the downpour
which the Proprietor had predicted.</p>

<h2>MAKING A STAR LION AND AN<br />

MEETING</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">"You</span> were not in this part of the country
when New York was in an uproar
for two days over the escape
of one of my lions," said the Proprietor
to the Stranger as they joined the Press
Agent. "I suppose that ninety per cent.
of the people who remember it think that
it was all a fake, but I can assure you that
I put in the most strenuous forty-eight
hours of my career while he was loose, and
it pretty nearly decided me to give up the
show business. It was my first experience at
running an independent show, and after
great persuasion I had induced my father to
let me bring some boxing kangaroos, two
young lions and Wallace, a fine big brute
about fifteen years old, from our English
establishment to the States. Wallace was
already a famous&mdash;or infamous&mdash;lion in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
England, where he had the score of three
trainers to his credit. He had received the
name of 'The Mankiller' over there, and
they were rather relieved to have me get him
out of the country.</p>

<p>"His last victim was a Frenchman, one
of the best-known trainers in the business,
and he went into the cage to subdue Wallace
on a wager. He won, and a remarkable performance
it was, but I won't take the time
to tell you about that now. He made just
one little mistake: his vanity got the better
of him when he turned his back on the lion to
bow to the audience after remaining in the
cage for ten minutes. As I said, he won
the bet, and it about paid the funeral expenses
of what was left of him. After that
the only man who could go near Wallace
was a half-breed American Indian from up
near Cape Cod; Broncho Boccacio, he called
himself. I don't know what the other half
of him was, and I don't remember how he
happened to be with our English show, but
all sorts and conditions of men drift into the
animal training business. At any rate, he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
was the only man who could do anything
with Wallace, and that wasn't much. He
would get into the cage and chase him
around a bit and then jump out quick&mdash;always
backward after seeing what happened
to the Frenchman. I brought him along to
take especial charge of the brute. It took
a couple of days to get the animals through
the customs, and in the meantime I cast
about for quarters and finally rented a stable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
on Eighteenth Street to keep them in until
I should secure an engagement." He took
a pencil from his pocket and drew a plan on
the white table top.</p>

these narrow stairs at the side leading up to
the loft. On each side of the door was a window
facing on the street, and back of the
carriage room was the stable proper&mdash;two
stalls and a loose-box. On one side of the
stable was a saloon and on the other a carpenter
shop, so I didn't expect much complaint
from my neighbors, as my men patronized
one, while I ordered the carpenter
to build a traveling cage for Wallace which
would slide on wheels, as our English cages
were too heavy to handle in a country where
labor is as high as it is here. I moved the
lions up to the stable to let them rest a bit
after the voyage and started to look for an
engagement. It was a hard row to hoe, as
I was not known in this country, and the best
I could do was a booking at a dime museum
for a month, and I had to take a lowish price<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
at that, but I ordered a big nine sheet poster
and trusted to luck to make more out of
them later.</p>

<p>"The lions were in three cages in the
stable, and in one of the stalls I had a trotting
horse which had been purchased for my
brother in England, and which I kept there
until I should have an opportunity to ship it
to the other side. The kangaroos were in
the loft, and a couple of days after they
were all settled my two little girls came over
from the hotel with me one morning and
went up there with the nurse to play with
them while I went into the carpenter shop
next door to settle for the new cage, which
had just been delivered. Broncho, as soon
as he struck his native soil, had discovered
a camp of other Indians on the Bowery and
spent most of his time in their encampment,
leaving a Cockney Englishman in charge of
the lions and the horse. I intended to wait
until he arrived before shifting Wallace to
the new cage, but the Englishman thought
he would show his cleverness and attempted
to do it alone without waiting for us. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
threw a piece of meat into the new cage and
then rolled it up to the old one, and when the
doors were opposite each other he opened
them. Of course Wallace made a spring for
the meat in the new cage, but he struck the
edge of the door, and as the Cockney had
neglected to block the wheels the cage rolled
away and the keeper gave a yell and bolted
for the stairs. There was a loose lion downstairs&mdash;and
a bad one at that&mdash;and the nurse
and two children in the loft.</p>

<p>"The first I knew of it was from the
nurse, who had grabbed the children and
stood with them in the door which had been
used to pass the hay in, yelling 'Fire!' and
'Murder!' but I knew that there was hell to
pay as soon as I reached the street, by the
sound which came from the stable. We got
a ladder from the carpenter shop and hustled
the nurse and children down to the
street, and then I went up to the loft, while
the nurse and the Cockney held the small
door from the stable to the street, which
could not be fastened from the outside until
the carpenter spiked some plank over it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>"A look into the stable convinced me that
I did not want to go down the stairs, for
with one blow Wallace had converted a thousand-dollar
trotting horse into two dollars'
worth of lion meat, and he was crouched on
the body, which he had dragged from the
stall, clawing at its throat and drinking the
blood. The place looked like a shambles, and
the growls which came from Wallace as the
other lions threw themselves against the bars
of their cages in their efforts to get out and
join in the feast were redoubled when he
caught sight of my head through the trap-door.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
I slammed it down and drew the kangaroo
cage on top of it and then went down
to the street to see that the windows and
doors were securely boarded up. A great
crowd was gathering and I was afraid that
the police would shoot the brute, for I saw
the possibilities of an advertisement which
would more than pay for the expensive meal
which Wallace was making from the trotting
horse.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 650px;"><a name="His_vanity_got_the_better_of_him_when_he_turned_his_back_on_the_lion_to_bow_to_the_audience" id="His_vanity_got_the_better_of_him_when_he_turned_his_back_on_the_lion_to_bow_to_the_audience"></a>
<img src="images/026.png" width="650" height="381" alt="" title="" />
"His vanity got the better of him when he turned his back on the lion, to bow to the audience."</div>



<p>"Just as I reached the street, Broncho
strolled up. As I said, he was a queer-looking
guy; his skin was copper-colored and he
had piercing black eyes and long, fuzzy
black hair which fell down to his shoulders.
His nose was hooked and something about
his face always reminded me of a bird of
prey. He was only a half-breed, but when
I told him what had occurred he was all Indian
and he drew a long knife and started
for the Cockney, who gave only one look at
the expression on Broncho's face and then
started for Harlem, touching only the high
spots until he was quite out of sight. Broncho
didn't chase him; he just looked after<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
him with a smile on his face, glad to see him
disappear, as there had been more or less bad
blood between them for a long time. Then
he came to me and laughed at the idea of
danger and offered to go into the stable and
put Wallace back in the cage. I knew that
it would be impossible until the lion had
gorged himself on horse meat, and now that
the damage was done I was in no hurry to
allay the excitement until the police and reporters
arrived. We didn't have to wait
long, for the crowd had grown until the
street was blocked, and, of course, the reporters
asked more than a thousand questions.
When I had worked the sensation up
pretty well I consented to let Broncho take
his training rod and go down, and I went
with him carrying a club and a pitchfork.
Things commenced to happen right away,
for Wallace didn't wait for the call of time,
but sailed right into us, and when I saw that
he was getting the better of Broncho I made
a bluff at going back to the carcass of the
horse. Wallace bounded back to protect it
and crouched on it, snarling viciously, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
the delay gave me a chance to help Broncho
up the stairway. There was not enough of
his trousers left to wad a gun, and while I
was bandaging up a deep claw wound in his
thigh that advertisement seemed less and less
important to me, and I would have given a
good deal to have Wallace safely behind the
bars of his cage again. He was contracted
for four weeks anyway, and it takes a pretty
big sensation to be remembered for more
than thirty days in New York.</p>

<p>"Well, we fussed about all day, trying to
figure out some way to get the beggar back
in his cage, and I got an earache listening to
advice from people who had never seen a
lion, but who considered themselves experts.
At sunset Wallace still held the fort and the
streets were blocked in all directions, for the
afternoon papers were out with extras with
scare-heads. The boards over the windows
made the interior of the stable so dark that
no one could see into it, but the roars which
came from it gave the spectators all the
thrills they were entitled to and caused a
stampede every few minutes. We tried to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
drive Wallace into the cage with a stream of
water from the fire plug, but he only shook
his head and growled at it, so we gave it up
and waited for daylight. There were about
forty policemen and a crowd of reporters
about the place all night, and I was getting
nervous for fear some fool would shoot the
lion, whose value was increasing every minute,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
so I kept awake and did a heap of
thinking.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 199px;"><a name="Broncho_was_only_a_half-breed" id="Broncho_was_only_a_half-breed"></a>
<img src="images/027.png" width="199" height="500" alt="" title="" />
"Broncho was only a half-breed."</div>



<p>"I knew that Wallace would fight for his
'kill' as long as any of the meat was left, so
we rigged up a tackle to try and draw the
carcass out. We were all ready at daylight
and the crowd was bigger than ever. Say,
if you want to count the idle people in New
York just get up a free show at any hour
of the day or night and they will all come.
There must have been over a thousand loafing
about the street all night. We were just
getting ready to make a try for the horse
when the idlers outside gave a cheer, and I
saw an express wagon loaded with nets and
ropes and all sorts of animal catching stuff
drive up. Tody Hamilton, Barnum's press
agent, had caught on to the possibilities of
an advertisement, and sent to the winter
quarters at Bridgeport for some of their
animal men to come down and capture a
loose lion. They supposed it was in Central
Park, and when they found it was in a
stable the job looked easy to them. One of
them, a man named McDonald, had been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
with our English show, and when he heard
that it was Wallace they were to tackle his
enthusiasm seemed to melt. He told the
others a few anecdotes of the lion, and two
of them went to find the Cockney, I guess,
for we never saw them again.</p>

<p>"We managed to throw a slip noose
around the carcass from the stairs, and when
we passed the end of the rope out of the
window there must have been five hundred
men pulling on it from the way that horse's
body slid across the floor. The four of us
stood around the trap-door to beat Wallace
back, and when he realized that he was losing
his prey it kept us busy.</p>

<p>"Say, a dead horse seems to have more
legs than a centipede when you try to drag
it through a narrow space, and they all stick
out in different directions. Of course, this
one stuck and then there was more trouble,
for when I took an axe to dismember it, a
cop threatened to arrest me for cutting up a
horse in the city limits. It took three hours
to satisfy the red-tape requirements and get
a permit from the Board of Health, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
then I had a long, sickening job, for we had
to haul up what was left of the poor beast
in fragments, and all the time Wallace was
snapping at them or rushing at us. We
gave him several nasty cracks over the snout,
the only place where a lion seems to be sensitive
to pain, but it only made him uglier
than ever and I knew that there was a pretty
fight ahead of us. It was a case of 'Perdicaris
alive or Raisouli dead' with me, for the
police were getting impatient, and I knew
they would shoot him if we did not get him
caged before night.</p>

<p>"We drew lots to see who should be the
first to go down, and I think that McDonald
stacked the straws, for Broncho won&mdash;or
lost&mdash;I was second, the other Barnum man
third and McDonald last; but he made good
after we got down there, and it was what
the President would have called a 'crowded
hour.' If Wallace hadn't been full of horse
meat, which made him a trifle slow, I think
he would have chased the bunch of us out,
and as it was he gave us all we wanted to do.
We used blank cartridges, Roman candles,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
training rods and whips, and I learned afterward
that the crowd outside thought we were
all being torn to pieces, but we finally conquered
and it was a singed and battered lion
which jumped back into the den and gave
me a chance to slam the door. The noise of
the clicking lock sounded good to me, and I
went up the stairs with a lighter heart, in
spite of tattered clothes and a scratched hand
and bruised body. I knew that I had a small
fortune in the beast, but I nearly cried when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
I went into the saloon to freshen up, and the
first thing I saw was the poster with the
announcement that Wallace would be shown
at the dime museum. I knew that it would
make the reporters, who had been writing
columns of space, suspect that it was all a
fake and prearranged. The manager was
afraid that I would renege on my contract
after all the free advertising, but he didn't
know me.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 650px;"><a name="We_didnt_have_any_regular_snake_charmer_but_Merritt_made_himself_up_for_a_Hindoo_fakir" id="We_didnt_have_any_regular_snake_charmer_but_Merritt_made_himself_up_for_a_Hindoo_fakir"></a>
<img src="images/028.png" width="650" height="403" alt="" title="" />
"We didn't have any regular snake charmer, but Merritt made himself up for a Hindoo fakir."</div>



<p>"Sure enough, the reporters came for me
in a body while I was still tired and dirty
from the fight and worn out with anxiety
and loss of sleep. They accused me of having
put up a job on them, but I guess the
sight of my condition convinced them of my
sincerity, for only one paper even hinted at
any crookedness, and that proved the best
advertisement in the whole business.</p>

<p>"It was the <i>Sun</i> which came out in an
article about Wallace, saying that he was
toothless and decrepit from old age, and
that there had never been the slightest danger
from him. If the reporter who wrote it
had gone into the stable with us, I don't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
think he would have written the article. I
did my own announcing in those days and I
always started off with the announcement,
'Ladies and gentlemen! If you see it in the
<i>Sun</i>, it's so, and the <i>Sun</i> says that Wallace
is played out and toothless from old age.'
Then I would make a move to the front of
the cage, and Wallace, who had a special
hatred for me, would spring at the bars and
show as pretty a set of fangs as you would
wish to see and I was always sure of a laugh.</p>

<p>"Well, I showed Wallace in New York
and other cities for thirty straight weeks
and got back the value of that trotter a good
many times over," continued the Proprietor
as he rose from the table. "His name is one
to conjure with, even yet, and nearly every
lion which is exhibited in the side shows at
the county fairs is billed as 'Wallace, the
Untamable!' The original Wallace is still
alive and at our English breeding establishment."
He said good-night and left the
table, the Press Agent looking regretfully
after him.</p>

<p>"That's just like the boss," he complained<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
as he watched the retreating figure. "He
takes the center of the stage until he has told
his story, and when my turn comes to get in
the limelight he does the disappearing act.
That was a pretty good story, but talking of
escapes, I can tell you about an escape that
is worth talking about. It happened when
a guy named Merritt and myself were running
a snake show next to a camp meeting
down on the Jersey coast. We didn't have
any regular snake charmer, but we bought
a lot of wrigglers from a dealer down on
the Bowery and Merritt made himself up
for a Hindoo fakir. He would get into
the cage with them and those snakes would
wrap themselves about him from his head
to his toes and it was an awe-inspiring sight.
He taught them to stand up on their tails
and dance while he played on a tin whistle
and to do other pretty little tricks, but the
great and original stunt was what he called
the 'Interminable Snake,' when one would
grab the biggest snake's tail in his mouth,
another would fasten onto him, and so on
until the whole blame lot looked like one big<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
serpent. Say, those snakes got so stuck
on that game that they would do it for
sport without the word of command. Whenever
one started to move around the cage
another would grab his tail, and the first
thing you knew the whole bunch was going
around in a string and the sight of it
was enough to make a man swear off for a
year.</p>

<p>"We were doing a fine business until a
temperance lecturer set up a show a little
way off, and that cut into us so that there
was nothing much doing. The crowd would
walk right past the entrance to our 'Highly
Moral and Instructive Exhibition,' and go
on to listen to the temperance guy telling
them about the evils of drink, as illustrated
by the horrible living examples which he had
upon the platform. You see that was a free
show, while ours cost a quarter&mdash;and cheap
at the price.</p>

<p>"One afternoon after I had cracked my
voice trying to draw the crowd without
landing one of 'em, Merritt comes to me,
and as we saw the crowd pouring in to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
temperance show, we looked at each other
and shook our heads in sorrow.</p>

<p>"'Jim,' says Merritt, 'that guy down
there has got you skinned to death on the
ballyhoo, and it's up to you to go over there
and get next to the attraction and see if we
can't cop it out for our show. I hate to ask
it of you,' says he, 'knowing your views on
the temperance question, but business is
business and this ain't no time for sentiment.'
It went against the grain, but I
knew it must be done, so I went down to the
lecture. I wasn't wise to the game, but I
was anxious not to miss a trick, so I went
right up to the front, and the first thing I
knew I was seated on the mourners' bench,
right under the platform. As soon as the
lecturer came on I piped him for a guy that
used to pull teeth on the Bowery with a
brass band accompaniment and a gasoline
torch, and I remembered that at that time
he could punish more booze than any man
I ever knew. He had the gift of gab all
right, and he had picked up a couple of
panhandlers for horrible examples and they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
looked the part. If either one of them had
ever drawn a sober breath in twenty years
he should have sued his face for libel, and
they looked as if they had been towed behind
a trolley car from the Battery to Fort
George.</p>

<p>"Well, the ex-jaw carpenter cut loose in
good form, and he soon had every one
worked up, telling the horrible things which
alcohol did to your interior lining, and giving
a description of the menagerie which a
man sees when he has the jim-jams, which
would have done credit to the boss lecturer
in there." He pointed with his thumb to
the Arena, and the alert waiter, taking it
for a signal, refilled the glasses.</p>

<p>"He did it so well that he sort of had me
going, and I was beginning to think that
possibly I was taking a trifle too much,"
continued the Press Agent, as he sampled
the fresh drink. "I was giving the matter
serious thought, when my attention was attracted
by one of the panhandlers who was
nudging his partner.</p>

<p>"'Bill,' says he, 'tell the old man to put<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
on full steam ahead, for I'm backsliding
and need encouragement. I'm afraid I've
got 'em again. Look there!' Bill looks
down the aisle and gets uneasy, too.</p>

<p>"'Hank,' says he, 'I've got 'em, likewise,
only that ain't my usual kind of snake, coz
he ain't got no plug hat with a red flannel
band on it; but it's me for the bromide and
the simple life.'</p>

<p>"'It's this damn Jersey whiskey that's
changed 'em,' answers Bill. 'Mine always
has gorillas ridin' 'em.' Well, I looked
around and I would have been scared myself
if I hadn't recognized our own bunch of
snakes, each one of 'em with the tail of the
snake in front of him in his mouth. Old
'Limber Larry'&mdash;we called him that on account
of his habit of going to sleep curled
up in a true lover's knot&mdash;was in the lead,
and behind him came about half a mile of
snakes.</p>

<p>"They were festooning themselves up the
aisle, coming slow, because there were a
couple of them which could not move very
fast, and when the gait got too lively they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
used to bite their leaders' tails. Old Larry
was raising his head and looking around
every few feet, and just when the lecturer
had reached the most thrilling part of his
'Ten Nights in a Barroom' spiel he caught
Larry's eye and the meeting adjourned,
<i>sine die</i>, right there. You couldn't see him
for dust as he broke for the nearest 'speakeasy,'
and the two panhandlers were hanging
on to his coat tails.</p>

<p>"Just then Merritt comes in looking worried,
for he had gone to sleep and let 'em get
away from him, but when he sees 'em he
takes his tin whistle out of his pocket and
goes back to the show, tooting it like a
blasted Pied Piper, the snakes following
along as meek as Mary's little lamb, and
most of the audience goes with him at a
quarter per."</p>

<p>"Did business improve?" asked the
Stranger.</p>

<p>"Improve? Why, my boy, after we put
that temperance show out of business we
just turned 'em away for three months.
Not only did we do a good business, but the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
hotel people put us on the free list at the
bar, because Merritt used to take 'em down
in 'Interminable Snake' formation for a dip
in the ocean every morning, and the hotel
press agent wrote it up as the daily appearance
of the gigantic sea serpent."</p>

<h2>KALSOMINING AN ELEPHANT</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">A delegation</span> from the National
Association of Press Agents which
was holding its annual meeting in
the interests of the Furtherance of Truth
and the Elevation of the Show Business
had left the meeting place in New York,
and after inspecting the various moral and
entertaining performances at Coney Island
was gathered about one of the white-topped
tables near the Dreamland tower. Colonel
Tody Hamilton, prince of press agents,
master of a picturesque vocabulary, inventor
of superlatives in the English language
and champion of veracity, pointed laughingly
toward the Arena, where the Proprietor
of the trained animal exhibition
was instructing a new barker how to make
the most out of a trick of one of the elephants
which was being used for ballyhoo<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
purposes in front of the entrance to his
show.</p>

<p>"Listen to him, gentlemen, and you will
be convinced that he is eligible to membership
in our truth-loving fraternity," he
remarked admiringly. The ungainly pachyderm
was standing on its hind legs, trumpeting
through its upraised trunk a protest
against the prodding of the sharp goad
which was forcing it to walk backward in
that absurd position. The voice of the Proprietor,
who was using a megaphone, came
to them distinctly as he invited the people
to look at "One of the greatest triumphs of
the animal trainer's art; something which
has never been exhibited in any country&mdash;an
elephant <span class="smcapl">WALKING UPON ITS HIND LEGS</span>,
BACKWARD!"</p>

<p>The speech caught and held the attention
of the crowd, and when the elephant was
allowed to rejoin its companions and the
three great beasts entered the building in
single file, Tom grasping Roger's tail in his
trunk and Alice following suit with the caudal
appendage of Tom, a goodly number<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
stepped up to the ticket booth and paid their
entrance money. The Colonel and his associates,
whose business had made them familiar
with elephants, smiled at the credulity
of the crowd, but acknowledged the Proprietor's
skill in attracting an audience.</p>

"Sam Watson confessed the whole thing."</div>



<p>"You wouldn't believe that I spent over
seven hundred dollars to turn that smallest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
elephant white a few years ago," said the
Colonel as the waiter refilled their glasses,
but his companions made unanimous protestation
that they would believe any statement
he made, and the Colonel settled back
comfortably in his chair to tell the story
which they demanded.</p>

<p>"You will have to listen to the story of the
famous war of the white elephants, then,"
he said, good-naturedly, "a struggle which
will remain famous in the circus world as
long as the big tops are spread. It was in
the good old days of fierce competition in
the business, the days when the press agents
earned every dollar of their salaries, and
sometimes had to go to the extent of saying
things in print which were not strictly true.
There was intense rivalry between the two
big shows, the P. T. Barnum and the Forepaugh
aggregations, and the bitter feeling
between the proprietors was transmitted to
the employees. The advance agents would
steal each other's printed matter and posters
out of the express offices, and you could always
count on a fight between the canvas<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
men whenever the two shows were close
enough together. They would damage each
other's property, loosen nuts on the wagons
so that the wheels would come off and cause
upsets, and do anything to embarrass the
rival show.</p>

<p>"Each show tried to outdo the other at
every point; advertising, number of performers,
length of the street parade, menagerie
collection and everything which money
could buy. They started in to see which could
get the largest herd of elephants, each advertising
the largest herd in captivity, and that
competition raised the price of elephants all
over the world and denuded every small
zoological park in Europe, while it pretty
nearly bankrupted the shows to feed them.
We had eighty with the Barnum circus, and
finally Mr. Barnum came to me and said
that he had purchased a Sacred White Elephant
and told me to start giving it publicity.
Of course, I didn't know anything
about that particular kind of elephant, but
as I always like to be perfectly accurate in
my statements I made a scientific study of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
it. I found that, as a matter of fact, there
was no such thing as a white elephant known
in natural history, although there was an
occasional absence of the usual pigment in
the skins of some beasts which give them
a trifle lighter color, and that these animals
were apt to have a few spots on the body
which were nearly white, just as you sometimes
hear of a negro who is spotted. When
such a spot occurs in the center of the forehead
the Buddhists regard the beast as
sacred, from the fact that the god, Buddha,
is always depicted as wearing a jewel in that
position and it is looked upon as his special
mark of protection. It is the ambition of
every Indian Rajah to possess one, for then
he is billed as 'The Lord of the Sacred
White Elephant,' a title which seems to fill
a long-felt want in the heart of an Oriental
potentate.</p>

<p>"Well, Barnum's agent had, by some
hook or crook, procured one of these and
sent it to London, but owing to the lateness
of the season it was decided to leave it there
in the Zoological Gardens and get up a controversy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
which, in itself, would be a good
advertisement for it. The average Englishman
is very fond of writing to the <i>Times</i> to
expose a fraud, and we knew that there
would be a protest from those who would be
disappointed in the brute's color. There are
hundreds of retired officers who have served
in India living in London, and they know all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
about Sacred White Elephants, and time
hangs heavily on their hands. They were
only too anxious to certify to its genuineness,
and they wrote the peppery kind of
replies to the criticisms which might be expected
from men who had spent the best
years of their lives under a hot sun and lived
upon curries and red peppers. Of course,
I saw that the letters were copied in the
home papers, and before the circus season
opened I had the Great American Public
watching anxiously for the reported sailing
of the Sacred White Elephant.</p>

"Walking upon its hind legs, <span class="smcapl">BACKWARD</span>."</div>



<p>"I should have been on my guard, for the
Forepaugh bunch just kept sawing wood
and saying nothing, but whenever I met
their press agent he gave me the quiet laugh.
Our elephant was finally shipped, and you
can imagine that I made the most of it in
the papers. I had 'em filled up for two days,
and then, while ours was still in mid-ocean,
out comes Forepaugh's announcement that
his Sacred White Elephant would land in
New York the following day. I knew it
was a fake, for they were very difficult to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
obtain, but they stole our thunder, just the
same. I managed to get a peep at it while
it was being unloaded, and although it was
only a dirty yellowish color, I knew that it
would make ours look like a decided brunette
by comparison. They had worked it
well and kept it quiet, but knowing that
there was a nigger in the woodpile and that
money would bring him out, I spent it like
a drunken sailor in trying to get information.</p>

<p>"Forepaugh had eminent scientists examine
the beast and give their certificates that
it was genuine, and all the inside information
I could get was that the elephant had
been purchased through Cross, the great
animal dealer in Liverpool, and that it had
been kept secluded in his place there all winter.
Sam Watson, who was Forepaugh's
foreign agent, and his groom, a man named
Telford, were the only people who had access
to it, and they had spent hours every
day in its stall. Cross would give us no information
as to how or where he obtained
the elephant, for Forepaugh bought all of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
the animals for his menagerie through him,
while we dealt with his great rival, Hagenbeck,
of Hamburg.</p>

<p>"Forepaugh got all the newspaper space
for the next few days, and when our elephant
finally arrived it looked mighty dark-colored
for a white elephant when compared
with the fake one. It was hard to educate
the people up to the significance of the little
white spot in the center of the forehead, but
any one but a blind man could see that Forepaugh's
fake was lighter in color. We went
at it, horse, foot and artillery, and the fight
cost the two shows more than a quarter of a
million dollars, and lasted until we patched
up a truce in St. Louis to save us both going
into bankruptcy. I got some of Cross's employees
to swear that they had seen the elephant
being painted in Liverpool, and Forepaugh
replied by getting a commission of
scientific sharps from Ann Arbor to examine
the beast and swear that the color was
natural. There was good money in perjury
and scientific opinions those days, but I
never let up for a minute in my endeavor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
to get at the truth of the matter, for I knew
it was hanky panky and I am a diligent
searcher after truth, especially when a rival
has sunk it to the bottom of a well. I experimented
with some of our elephants until I
nearly took their thick hides off, but I could
get no satisfactory results until I called in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
Marchand, the chemist, and asked him if he
could give me something to bleach an elephant.
He had an especially strong solution
of peroxide of hydrogen made up, and I
selected the smallest animal out of our herd
of eighty to try it on. It happened to be the
one which you just saw working on the
ballyhoo over there, which you noticed was
the ordinary slate color. We soaked cloths
in the peroxide and covered the beast with
them and then put blankets on top. After
they had been on for awhile we washed the
animal with ammonia and water and repeated
the performance until that elephant
was as white as snow.</p>

"Forepaugh had eminent scientists examine the beast."</div>



<p>"Forepaugh was to open in Philadelphia,
so I shipped our fake over there, and when
they had their street parade I followed right
behind it with our bleached animal on a
truck which was liberally placarded. The
notices called attention to the fact that Forepaugh's
alleged sacred elephant was simply
painted and that the men who did it were
bunglers at the business. '<span class="smcap">Look at This
One!</span>' read our largest placard. '<span class="smcap">We<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
TELL YOU that it is a FAKE!</span> So is
Forepaugh's, but he won't tell! This is A
BETTER JOB BY A BETTER ARTIST!'
That made the Forepaugh people
hot, and they replied with a new bunch of
affidavits and expert opinions from a lot
of University of Pennsylvania professors.
That couldn't offset our show-up, though,
and the whole situation had become so mixed
that the public thought all of the elephants
were fakes. We had the only genuine one
and the best fake also, but they were a pair
of white elephants in every sense of the
term, and a losing proposition. The one
which we had bleached would only keep
white for about two weeks, and as each
treatment cost seven hundred dollars Barnum
called me off. The Forepaugh bunch
was trying to poison it, and as the whole
thing was dead as a money-making venture
and white elephants a drug in the market,
we let this one regain its natural color.
When the great herd was broken up it was
sold off, and I never saw it again until to-night."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>"But what was the inside history of the
Forepaugh white elephant?" asked one of
his companions, and the Colonel smiled as he
lighted a fresh cigar.</p>

<p>"I never knew it until this year, when one
night over a friendly drink Sam Watson,
who is now a clown with the Big Show, confessed
the whole thing. Forepaugh is dead
and the shows have been consolidated, so
there is no further object in keeping the
thing quiet. It seems that Forepaugh's
agents found out that Barnum had purchased
the elephant from an impecunious
Indian Rajah; in fact, he had purchased
two, the first one having died on its way
to England. It was the misdirection of a
cable announcing the death and ordering
another at any cost which put them wise to
the fact that Barnum had a rarity. Watson
had never heard of a sacred elephant, but he
started out to get one when he read that
cablegram. They were scarce articles, and
Barnum had bought the only two which
were to be had for love or money in all India,
so he and Cross got their heads together and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
started out to manufacture a bogus one in
Liverpool.</p>

<p>"They prepared a closed stall, which was
always kept locked, and put an elephant in
it&mdash;just a common, or garden, elephant.
Then Sam and his groom, Telford, proceeded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
to get busy with bath bricks, pumice
stone and a barrel of white aniline dye. I
imagine they had a pretty hard winter's
work and it was certainly a tough period for
the elephant, because they had to scrape
about half the skin off the poor brute before
the dye would take hold. They finally succeeded
in getting him several shades lighter
than normal, all except about eighteen
inches at the end of the trunk. They could
do nothing with that on account of the habit
of the beast, which was always mussing
around in its bedding, searching for stray
peanuts.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 513px;"><a name="Then_Sam_and_his_groom_Telford_proceeded_to_get_busy" id="Then_Sam_and_his_groom_Telford_proceeded_to_get_busy"></a>
<img src="images/032.png" width="513" height="500" alt="" title="" />
"Then Sam and his groom, Telford, proceeded to get busy."</div>



<p>"They kept in touch with the London
Zoo and found out when we were to ship the
genuine one, and then got their fake on a
steamer which would land it in New York
a few days ahead of us. Of course, they
had to keep working at it all the way over,
but they kept it quiet and no one caught on.
When the scientific sharps came to examine
it, Sam would hoist the trunk up in the air
while he drew their attention to the marvelous
whiteness of the under side, and no one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
caught on to the fact that the end of the
trunk was the natural color.</p>

<p>"He let them remove some bits of skin for
microscopic examination to prove that no
dye was used, but he always had them taken
from the inner side of the foreleg near the
body, from which the natural pigment is
absent in all elephants. Sam swears that
they never had to fix one of the experts;
they were only too anxious to get the advertisement,
and they were prepared to swear,
and did in this particular case, that black
was white.</p>

<p>"I have a few gray hairs in my head, and
most of them came during the strain of that
fight. The game isn't what it used to be
and I'm glad that it isn't, and let me tell you,
as a result of long experience, that the worst
thing which can happen to a man is to have
a white elephant, fake or genuine, on his
hands."</p>

<h2>THE HYPNOTIC BEAR<br />
AND THE<br />
SENTIMENTAL LECTURER</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">The</span> doctor shook his head as he
slipped his ophthalmoscope into his
pocket, and Rey, the trainer, who
had been holding the bear's head still while
the oculist made the examination, opened
the door of the cage for him. The bear&mdash;a
medium-sized black animal&mdash;wandered
aimlessly about, stumbling over the water
pan and knocking its head against the bars,
its eyes, which were evidently sightless,
shining like two fiery opals as they reflected
the electric light.</p>

<p>"I am sorry to tell you that it is a hopeless
case," said the physician to the Proprietor,
who was standing with the Stranger in front
of the cage watching the examination.
"Both optic nerves are atrophied, and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
animal must have received some serious injury,
possibly a heavy blow on the forehead."
The Proprietor, who has the reputation
of being a "good loser," thanked him
and gave some directions to the trainer
about the care of the animal before leading
the way to the table in front of the Arena,
where the Press Agent was waiting for
them.</p>

<p>"It is rather unusual to call the most
famous specialist in the country to examine
a menagerie animal," he said, after the doctor
hurriedly left them to catch the express
train back to the city. "You know that he
takes no small fee; his services are either
given for charity or his charge is very high&mdash;and
this visit was not for charity."</p>

<p>"I should think that the value of a bear
would hardly warrant the expense," answered
the Stranger as the waiter filled the
glasses.</p>

<p>"It wouldn't be for an ordinary bear, but
I was willing to pay anything in reason to
restore the sight of this particular specimen,
so I sent for the best-known oculist in New<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
York. The decision which he has just given
will probably mean a loss of thousands of
dollars to me, but that is one of the risks
which I have to assume. Would it interest
you to hear a rather unusual romance of the
menagerie business?" The Stranger gave
eager assent, and the Press Agent settled
himself comfortably and lighted a cigar.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 383px;"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187"></a>
<img src="images/033.png" width="383" height="500" alt="" title="" />
"There seems to be a sympathy between them."</div>



<p>"You have no idea how many animals
are offered to the owner of a menagerie and
from what unusual sources the offers come,"
said the Proprietor. "Travelers in far countries
bring back strange animals as pets or
curiosities; people buy young wild animals
which get beyond control when they mature
and become veritable white elephants on
their hands, and their owners have to dispose
of them. I have had everything from monkeys
to lions brought to me, and so it did not
surprise me when an artist came to the Hippodrome
in Paris last winter and asked me if
I didn't want to purchase a bear. He
seemed anxious for me to see it immediately,
and at his earnest solicitation I got in a cab
with him and drove to his studio, which was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
situated on the far side of the Seine. The
bear which you saw examined to-night was
in a small room adjoining the studio, chained
to a ring in the wall.</p>

<p>"The apartment was luxuriously furnished,
and I realized that it was not lack of
ready money which made the artist so
anxious to dispose of the brute; but he
seemed in a desperate hurry to have me take
it away, and offered it for such a low price
that I closed the bargain at once. I suggested
sending one of my men for it in the
evening, but he insisted upon my taking it
with me, and as the bear was evidently as
gentle as a kitten I called a closed cab and
drove away with it. The bear sat comfortably
on the seat beside me and gave no
trouble, but as we drove along I got to
thinking the matter over and the whole proceeding
seemed a little strange. I had
Mephisto, as the bear was named, put in a
cage well away from the other animals&mdash;a
sort of quarantine precaution which I always
take with new arrivals&mdash;and as there was
apparently nothing unusual about him gave<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
him little attention, there being for the moment
no group of animals in training for
which he would be available. I soon noticed
that during the intermissions, when the
audience wandered about and examined the
animals in the cages, there was always a
crowd of women about his den; but I
thought that it was because he was such an
inveterate beggar, and had a habit of standing
at the bars with his mouth wide open,
waiting for some one to flick a lump of
sugar into it.</p>

<p>"The bear had given us no trouble, and
there was only one peculiar thing about him:
he seemed to have an aversion to cats. The
bodies of three of them had been found in
front of his cage, although we had never
seen one killed. The cats about a menagerie
instinctively keep out of harm's way, and it
puzzled me to know how Mephisto had managed
to get them within reach of his heavy
paw. Jack Bonavita, who fusses about his
lions at all hours of the day and night,
solved that mystery and incidentally saved
his pet cat, Tramp, from an untimely ending.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
Tramp has been with Jack for years
and appreciates the folly of venturing
within reach of the animals in the cages, but
Bonavita came across him in front of Mephisto's
cage in the middle of the night. The
bear was absolutely quiet, lying with its head
on its paws and its eyes, which glistened like
two points of flame, fixed on the cat. Tramp
was staring at it in turn and slowly drawing
nearer to the cage, apparently struggling
against some influence which was stronger<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
than its will. Bonavita watched them for a
few minutes, but before the cat ventured
within striking distance he picked it up and
carried it away, while Mephisto, growling
with rage, tried to break through the stout
bars and get at it.</p>

"Tramp was slowly drawing nearer to the cage."</div>



<p>"Two days before we were to sail for
America I was sitting at my desk arranging
some of the last details of shipment, when
the door burst open and a well-dressed,
handsome woman rushed in, followed by the
artist who had sold me the bear. She was
in a tearing rage and jabbering excitedly in
a language which I did not understand,
while the artist was trying to quiet her. She
pushed him aside, and opening a purse
which was well stuffed with banknotes, she
asked in French, which she spoke with a
marked foreign accent, for how much I
would sell Mephisto. The artist protested,
but she turned on him and gave him a
tongue lashing of which I could guess the
meaning, although the words were unintelligible
to me. I couldn't quite grasp the
situation, but the strange hypnotic power<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
which the bear apparently exercised over
cats had excited my curiosity, and I wished
to investigate it at my leisure, so I politely
but positively refused to name a price,
and told her the animal was not for sale.
The artist seemed relieved and she was
very much disappointed, but she quieted
down and asked me what I intended to do
with the animal. I told her that I was taking
it to America, where it would be put in
a mixed group which Rey was to train, and
after inquiring when we were to sail, they
left the office.</p>

<p>"I regretted that I had not taken the opportunity
to find out something about the
history of the animal, and looked over the
audience to try to locate the couple, but they
had left the building. One of the keepers
told me that she had screamed when she
recognized the bear and called it by name.
She was trying to bribe him to let her go
into the cage when the artist came up and
expostulated with her, and they had an
awful row before coming to my office. I
heard nothing more from them and we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
shipped the animals at Havre the following
day. The traveling dens were placed in the
'tween decks, which is not a pleasant place
to be when the ship is tossing about, and I
was surprised the second day out to find the
woman who had tried to purchase Mephisto
standing in front of his cage in that smelly
place, talking to the bear as if it were a child.
She laughed when I came up to her, and
told me that as I would not part with the
bear I would have to take her with the show.
I, too, laughed, for I have a large family of
daughters, and I knew that the simple traveling
gown which she wore had cost more
than two months' salary of my best trainer,
but to my great surprise she was in dead
earnest, and asked me seriously if I would
not let her train a group of animals."</p>

<p>The Press Agent grew very attentive, but
the Proprietor told him that he was not
talking for publication, and that a name
which occupied several pages of the Almanach
de Gotha was sacred, even from an
American promoter of publicity.</p>

<p>"And she does carry that name and was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
born to it," he continued, "but I can't tell
you what it is. She didn't tell it to me and
it was not on the passenger list, but the
ambassador from a great European nation
came on from Washington to see her and
remonstrate with her and to influence me
to exclude her from the show. I wouldn't
consent to that, but I am afraid that the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
accident of the bear's going blind will be the
cause of my losing an act which promised
to be sensational."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 454px;"><a name="The_bear_sat_comfortably_on_the_seat_beside_me" id="The_bear_sat_comfortably_on_the_seat_beside_me"></a>
<img src="images/035.png" width="454" height="500" alt="" title="" />
"The bear sat comfortably on the seat beside me."</div>



<p>"You have kept it quiet enough," said
the Press Agent with a trace of resentment
in his voice. "It sounds to me as if it ought
to be good for a front-page column in every
New York paper."</p>

<p>"As I told you, there are reasons why I
can't exploit it," answered the Proprietor.
"I am counting upon it for my opening
sensation at the Paris Hippodrome next
winter, and I don't intend to discount it before
a Coney Island audience. But to get
back to my experience with her on the
steamer. I found that she occupied the
most expensive deck stateroom, and had a
maid and a man servant traveling with her;
so that I refused all of her renewed offers
for the bear when I found the powerful fascination
it had for her, and I finally consented
to let her try the experiment of working
with a group of animals. You know the
class from which trainers are usually recruited,
and you can imagine the interest I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
take in a woman who possesses an absolute
fearlessness which is inherited from generations
of ancestors who have never shown the
white feather, in addition to education and
intelligence. The only thing which puzzled
me was her motive, and that I have not discovered
yet, although the ambassador, who
had received all sorts of communications
about her from his own government, told me
her history. It seems that she has always
been noted for her eccentricity and her rebellion
against the strict laws of convention
which were supposed to control her life, and
this is not the first time she has defied them.
She had commissioned the artist&mdash;who, by
the way, is one of the most celebrated men
in Paris&mdash;to paint a portrait of her. At the
same time he was painting an exhibition picture
to be called the 'Dancing Bear,' and
had purchased Mephisto for a model. The
picture was to represent the bear dancing
on its hind legs opposite a woman, to the
music of a flageolet played by a man bear
leader&mdash;such an exhibition as is commonly
given at the country fairs throughout Europe.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
He had no difficulty in getting a male
model, but he was in despair about the
woman dancer. He tried model after
model, and although they started in all right
each one became so nervous after a sitting
or two that they refused to continue. The
bear was chained to the wall and they were
posed safely out of reach, but each of them
asserted that the animal was like a serpent
and trying to charm them so that they would
come close enough to be caught. They were
all afraid that they might yield to the fascination
and be seriously injured. Tramp,
the cat, would probably have told the same
story if he had been able to talk.</p>

<p>"As a matter of curiosity the artist experimented
with men, but the bear appeared
indifferent to them and the men made no
complaint. It only seemed to exercise this
strange hypnotic power over women&mdash;and
cats&mdash;for the artist found two Persian
felines, which had been studio pets, dead
beside it; simply crushed, as were those
which were killed by the bear at the Hippodrome.
He mentioned the matter during<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
one of the sittings for the portrait, and the
lady, being curious to see the animal, came
to his studio&mdash;and then the trouble commenced.
She developed a most unaccountable
attachment for Mephisto, and he was
as gentle as a lamb with her. They would
sit facing each other by the hour, and the
artist swore they talked to each other and
understood each other perfectly. The animal
never attempted to harm her, but the
artist became alarmed for fear there should
be an accident, and believing that there was
something uncanny about the brute, he decided
to get rid of it and sold it to me.</p>

<p>"Well, I watched her with the bear on
shipboard and since we landed, and I can't
yet understand her control over it, for it
does not control her in any way. There
seems to be a sympathy between them which
makes them absolutely understand each
other, and through it she understands the
other caged beasts. The act which I had
framed for her when I found that she was
absolutely in earnest was a dance to be given
in the midst of a group of adult lions. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
lady is absolutely fearless and approved the
plan, but stipulated that she should select
the lions.</p>

<p>"'I have means of knowing which ones
will behave and which are such idiots that
they can't be controlled if anything goes
wrong,' she answered when I suggested that
I was a better judge of the dispositions of
the lions. 'I don't intend to have my beauty
spoiled,' she said, 'and I only want beasts
which are intelligent. No one can trust a
fool.' Perhaps I have fallen under her influence,
which according to her standard
should indicate intelligence, for I have given
way at every point and her judgment has
proved correct, for in rehearsing the act she
has perfect control over the animals, three of
which I considered the most vicious in the
menagerie. I let her take them in fear and
trembling.</p>

<p>"For the past three days she has been
anxious and uneasy about the bear and has
insisted that it was rapidly going blind. She
says that the bear is her teacher about things
in the animal world, and that she can tell<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
what it is thinking about. Its eyes look perfectly
sound, and it is only for two days that
we have noticed anything wrong with it.
Mephisto knew its way about its old cage so
well that it gave no evidence of blindness,
and a bear is naturally clumsy in its movements,
but when we moved it to a strange
den it stumbled over everything. I experimented
by bringing Tramp in front of its
cage, but with the loss of sight the hypnotic
power has apparently deserted it, and the
cat paid no attention to it. Finally I called
in the doctor and you heard him pronounce
his verdict."</p>

<p>"But where is the great loss?" asked the
Stranger.</p>

<p>"It is principally a loss in prospective
profits," replied the Proprietor as he beckoned
to the waiter. "I had the new act all
planned out for Paris&mdash;the lady was to appear
masked for her performance, but I
knew her identity would be discovered and
that it would be a tremendous sensation. I
don't know how much of her desire to train
animals is due to eccentricity and as a protest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
against the conventions which hedged
in her former life, and how much to her
strange infatuation for Mephisto, but since
its blindness has developed she has lost interest
and I suppose she will renege on the
whole business."</p>

<p>"How do you account for it all&mdash;her infatuation
for the bear and her intuitive
knowledge of the dispositions of the lions?"
asked the Stranger.</p>

<p>"I don't try to account for anything. It
is one of the thousand things about animals
and the million things about women which
no mere man can understand," replied the
Proprietor laughing. "I have simply given
you the facts of the situation and you can
draw your own conclusions, but the bear's
blindness upsets my plans and possibly prevents
a sensation in circles which approach
royalty."</p>

<p>"Women <i>are</i> difficult to understand,"
agreed the Press Agent as the Proprietor
paused to moisten his throat, "and a man
who is in love with one of 'em is just about
as unaccountable for his actions. I had that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
fact engraved upon the tablets of my memory
when a guy named Merritt and myself
were running a dime museum in Pittsburg.
Merritt was a good, hard-headed business
man as a rule and he made a first-class lecturer;
but when I found that he was taking
to 'dropping into poetry' and delivering his
descriptions of the freaks in verse, I began
to get leary about the condition of the contents
of his head. The poetry was always
extemporaneous and was pretty bad, but it
amused the crowd when it wasn't too sentimental.</p>

<p>"As I say, the poetry was strictly on the
bum, but what it lacked in quality it made
up in quantity and he could spiel it off by
the yard. Whenever he got stuck for a
rhyme he would blow the whistle which he
used to call the crowd in front of the freak
he was lecturing about and move to the next
platform. That didn't happen often, but
whenever we had a Circassian Beauty
among the freaks Merritt's poetry got so
sentimental that no one but a bride and
groom could stand for it&mdash;and it had to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
early in the honeymoon at that. He would
ring in turtle doves and azure skies and all
the wishy-washy things in natural history
and mythology and it was positively sickening.</p>

<p>"He sure had a soft place in his heart for
Circassian Beauties, and as they were as
common as wire tappers on Broadway under
a reform administration he was always getting
sentimental. We used to get a new lot
of freaks each week; our agent in New
York engaged 'em and sent on the advertising
matter ahead, and when we looked
over the list I could see Merritt's face
brighten up if there happened to be one of
the fuzzy blondes included in the bunch.</p>

<p>"Business was good, in spite of Merritt's
poetry, so that I didn't kick when I saw that
another one was coming. It was a good assortment:
a Legless Wonder, The Man
Who Breaks Paving Stones With His Bare
Fists, a pair of Siamese Twins, a Leopard
Boy and a particularly fuzzy Circassian
Beauty. I saw Merritt's eyes grow soft
when he looked at her photograph, and I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
prayed for a large proportion of the newly
wedded among the audience that week.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 387px;"><a name="He_made_sheeps_eyes_and_threw_a_chest" id="He_made_sheeps_eyes_and_threw_a_chest"></a>
<img src="images/036.png" width="387" height="500" alt="" title="" />
"He made sheep's eyes and threw a chest."</div>



<p>"Well, Merritt starts in with the Stone
Breaker and restrains himself pretty well;
the only sentiment he got in was a fervent
wish that 'a certain blonde beauty, with
eyes of cerulean blue, would not break a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
heart which time would prove tender and
true,' as ruthlessly as this man cracked
rocks. He was gradually working up to
the blonde, you understand, and he got
warmer as he approached. The next one
was the Legless Wonder, and he got a little
tangled up in his comparisons when he
sprung his poetry about him and tried to
ring in the Circassian, and he had to blow
his whistle like blazes to spare the blushes
of the audience. The Siamese Twins gave
him a good opening about 'bonds eternal'
and the 'season vernal' and he didn't do a
thing with it. The Leopard Boy was a
cinch for him as he declaimed that</p>

<div class="cpoem"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'They say that beauty is but skin deep.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as you gaze upon this freak,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You will, I think, agree with me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That though beneath he fair may be,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You'd much prefer to look the same<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the fair being who next will claim<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our admiration and attention,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With charms too numerous to mention.'<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>"That made the Leopard Boy mad, for
you know that freaks are as proud of their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
deformities as a mother is of a new baby,
and look on normal people as objects of
pity. But Merritt blew his whistle and
passed on to the Circassian, and he made
sheep's eyes and threw a chest as his fingers
toyed with her peroxide locks. Say, it was
sickening to listen to, and I saw that even
the Stone Breaker was showing signs of
distress and couldn't stand much of it. He
bore up pretty well at first, while Merritt
stuck to describing the 'golden locks and
eyes of blue,' but when he got to the
'sugar is sweet and so are you,' stage he
commenced to get mad and moved over to
the platform.</p>

<p>"'Say, Mag,' says he, 'get down offen
dat staige an' come away from de guy. It
ain't in our contrac' dat we has ter stand for
his gettin' soft on youse an' stringin' youse
like dat. Come down, er I'll climb up an'
break his face fer him.'</p>

<p>"'Sure, Mike,' says the blonde, and
climbs down. That made Merritt mad and
he talks real English without any poetic
frills for a minute. He allowed that he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
could lick any Stone Breaker that ever
came off the Bowery, and when he started
to prove it there was a mix-up which made
the breaking up of 'The Society upon the
Stanislaus' look like a fist fight between
two Frenchmen. The walls were covered
with curiosities from all over the world, and
pretty soon they were flying through the
air. Merritt yanked down an Indian war
club and started for the Stone Breaker and
somebody swatted him over the head with
a mummy. The Legless Wonder couldn't
join in, but he contributed a two-headed
calf which was preserved in a jar of alcohol,
and the Leopard Boy grabbed a bunch of
Zulu spears and prodded every one in reach.
Even the blonde was something of a scrapper
and she mixed in with a miscellaneous
assortment of stuffed animals and preserved
specimens, to say nothing of some
choice language which she hadn't learned
in Circassia. The place was pretty well
wrecked by the time the police arrived and
separated the fighters.</p>

<p>"'What's all this row about, anyway?'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
asks the sergeant after they had quieted
things down.</p>

<p>"'Dat guy was tryin' to get nex' to me
wife, de Circassian Beaut',' answers the
Stone Breaker. 'He spouts bum poetry
about her, an' I won't stand fer it, see?
Leave me go an' I'll crack his nut as easy
as I would a pavin' stone.' Merritt had
lots of fight left in him and tried to break
loose, but the Circassian's remarks wilted
him and I never knew him to use poetry
again.</p>

<p>"'Aw, wot's de use, Mike?' says she.
'Youse can't crack a ting dat ain't hard,
an' his sky-piece is made of mush.'"</p>

<h2>THE TRAGEDY OF THE TIGERS<br />
AND THE<br />
POWER OF HYPNOTISM</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Chauncey Depew</span> was at the
bottom of all the trouble; not the
punctured senator from the state of
New York, but his namesake, one of the
handsomest double-striped royal Bengal
tigers ever captured. Depew was the central
figure in the group which Miller, the
trainer of tigers, had worked so hard to educate,
and it was his rebellion which made the
teacher's labors of years come to naught.
Late in the season, after months spent in
giving the finishing touches to their education
while they were with a small part of the
show which was exhibited near Cleveland,
the tigers were brought to Dreamland; a
group of eight magnificent beasts, all jungle
bred and each worthy of a place in any menagerie.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
Perhaps it was the discomfort of
the journey in the small traveling cages,
possibly the change in the surroundings and
the nearness of the other animals excited
them; but whatever the cause, there was
trouble in the narrow runway at the back of
the dens when they entered it to go to the
exhibition cage for their first Coney Island
appearance.</p>

<p>The sound of their snarling and growling,
the reports of pistol shots and the
cracking of training whips caused a sensation
of uneasiness in the audience until the
first tiger bounded through the door at the
back of the cage, closely followed by a half-dozen
others. Dangerous beasts they looked
as they threw themselves against the stout
bars, which rattled from the impact of their
great bodies, and the front seats of the auditorium
were quickly vacated by the audience.
The noise in the runway continued,
but the deep throaty growls which came
from behind the dens were of a different
quality from the snarling and yapping
of the seven beasts in the exhibition cage,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
and when the last of the tigers appeared in
the doorway the first arrivals made renewed
efforts to escape through the bars.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 422px;"><a name="The_first_tiger_bounded_through_the_door" id="The_first_tiger_bounded_through_the_door"></a>
<img src="images/037.png" width="422" height="500" alt="" title="" />
"The first tiger bounded through the door."</div>



<p>It was Depew; not the good-natured-looking
great cat whose "I-have-eaten-the-canary"
expression and smug whiskers had
suggested his name, but a jungle tiger who
had "gone bad," as the animal trainers call
it, and who stood for a moment in the doorway,
wrathfully surveying his frantic companions
and selecting a victim. Froth was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
dripping from his snarling lips, his small
eyes were blazing like two points of flame,
the hair on his neck and back stood up like
bristles, and his great tail struck the door-casing
resounding whacks, as he lashed it
from side to side. Only a moment he stood
there, and then the great striped body hurtled
through the air as if shot from a catapult,
and covering a good twenty feet in the
spring it landed fair on Bombay, one of the
largest tigers in the group. The aim was a
true one and the sound of breaking bone
mingled with a scream of pain from his victim,
as Bombay sank under the weight of
the blow, his cervical vertebr&aelig; crushed between
Depew's powerful jaws.</p>

<p>The door had been closed behind Depew
when he made his spring, and the other
tigers were chasing madly about the great
cage, looking for a chance to escape. There
was no desire to fight left in them, but when
they collided with each other they snapped
and struck with the instinct of self-preservation,
their sharp claws and teeth cutting
gashes in the sleek striped coats. It was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
evident that all training had been forgotten,
that fear of anything so puny as man had
departed from the minds of the tigers, and
a groan went up from the audience when
the door was opened and quickly closed behind
Miller, the trainer, who stood, whip and
training rod in hand, in the cage with the
maddened animals. He went about his
work as quietly as if it were only an ordinary
performance, his object being to return his
pupils to their dens before further damage
was done and to try to make them recognize
that they were obeying him.</p>

<p>Depew was still crouched on the body of
his victim, biting at the neck and growling
ferociously, his tail lashing from side to side.
Miller never took his eyes from him and
kept between him and the door as he called
the others by name and tried to regain control
of them. One tiger after another was
released, glad of the opportunity to escape,
as the door to the runway was opened at
Miller's signal, until only Depew, the body
of Bombay and the trainer occupied the
cage.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>The other tigers had entered into a general
free fight in the runway, but the noise
of their bickering was unheeded in the excitement
of the contest in the exhibition
cage. Depew rose as Miller cracked his
whip and approached him, and made a rush
which the trainer met with his pronged training
rod, driving it hard between the widely
opened jaws while his whip rained blows
upon the tiger's face. But he was only
checked for a moment, and under his fiercer
attack the trainer was forced to give ground.
They were so close that the tiger could not
spring, but he struck savagely with his great
forepaws and tried again and again to pass
the guard which Miller maintained with the
training rod, using it as a fencer uses a foil.
It was an unequal contest and the trainer
realized that he was beaten; Depew would
not be driven from the cage. The useless
training whip was discarded and a savage
rush from the tiger was met by a pistol
shot in the face, blank cartridge, of course,
but effective for a moment. Five more shots
followed in quick succession and the trainer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
backed quickly toward the door, when his
foot slipped, he was on his back, and Depew,
quick to seize the advantage, stood over him.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 385px;"><a name="Depew_was_still_crouched_on_the_body_of_his_victim" id="Depew_was_still_crouched_on_the_body_of_his_victim"></a>
<img src="images/038.png" width="385" height="500" alt="" title="" />
"Depew was still crouched on the body of his victim."</div>



<p>Every keeper connected with the show
stood about the cage with the Roman candles,
fire extinguishers, pistols and irons
which are always kept in readiness, and any
or all of them would have willingly entered
to rescue the man, but experience has taught<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
them that two cannot work together in a
cage with animals. They were quick to
act and a stream of water under heavy
pressure from the fire hose struck the
tiger in the side, exploding fireworks
scorched his skin, the din of revolver shots
was in his ears, while the wads from the
cartridges stung him, but he seemed conscious
only of the prostrate form beneath
him. At last his chance had come; the
trainer who for long months had made
him do foolish things which were beneath
the dignity of a royal tiger was in his power;
the revolver which had so often checked him
was emptied; the cruel training rod was
powerless, for the hand which held it was
pinned to the floor by a huge paw. Cat-like
he paused to glory in his triumph, loath to
give the <i>coup de gr&acirc;ce</i> which would put his
victim beyond the reach of suffering, and he
stood there growling, the bloody slaver from
his jaws dripping on the upturned face of
the prostrate man.</p>

<p>Animal trainers need to think quickly and
to seize the slightest moment of hesitation or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
indecision on the part of their pupils if they
wish to be long-lived, and Miller, as he fell,
had thrown his useless pistol out of the cage
and uttered the one word "Load!" There
was no time for that, but Tudor, seeing that
the trainer had one arm free, threw his own
pistol through the bars and it slid across the
floor of the cage straight as a die to the outstretched
hand. It was a time when fractions
of a second count and Depew's hesitation
robbed him of his revenge. The opened
jaws were within a foot of the trainer's
throat when the muzzle of the pistol went between
them, and Depew, coughing and
choking, drew back, his throat scorched by
the burning powder, his eyes momentarily
blinded by the stream from a fire extinguisher,
while Miller struggled to his feet.</p>

<p>"People who see the crowds at my show
think that I must coin money," said the Proprietor
as he joined the Press Agent and the
Stranger after the performance. "But that
accident in the Arena to-night means a loss
of fifty thousand dollars to me."</p>

<p>"Isn't that a high figure, even if they all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
die?" asked the Stranger, who had been doing
a little mental arithmetic.</p>

<p>"For those eight, yes, although a trained
tiger is worth all sorts of money, but I have
purchased twenty-eight in all for that
group, and the others have been killed one
by one, fighting among themselves. They
average over a thousand apiece, for I bought
only the best, and figure up the cost of their
keep, transportation and trainer's salaries
for three years and you will find that I am
not far out. That is the difficulty of the
show business in America, the public demands
so much. It is a marvelous thing,
when you come to think of it, to see one educated
tiger; but if he wore evening clothes
and played the fiddle it wouldn't impress the
Americans; they would demand a full orchestra.
I can give an act an hour long in
Paris with one high school horse, but here
they want fifty liberty horses in a bunch and
only care to watch them for ten minutes. I
realized that from Bonavita's act with the
lions; no individual lion did very much, but
the fact that there were twenty-seven of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
them in the cage drew the crowds. That's
what made me start in with the tigers, and I
intended to get a big group, but now I am
back where I started from. I don't believe
a troupe of tigers can ever be trained."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 650px;"><a name="Depew_coughing_and_choking_drew_back" id="Depew_coughing_and_choking_drew_back"></a>
<img src="images/039.png" width="650" height="478" alt="" title="" />
"Depew, coughing and choking, drew back."</div>



<p>"Hagenbeck has them," ventured the
Stranger. "They seem as tame as kittens
with his show."</p>

<p>"That's just the point," answered the
Proprietor. "They are as tame as kittens:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
undersized brutes which have been raised in
captivity and which go through their act like
domestic cats. That isn't what the public
wants. A sensation&mdash;the realization that
every animal in the cage is a wild animal and
that he is liable to remember it at any minute&mdash;is
what holds attention. That is why I
always use jungle animals when I can get
them, for, although they can be as well
trained, they always perform under protest
and it makes it exciting. But the losses
from fighting among themselves make it
mighty expensive to keep up the big groups
which the American public demands."</p>

<p>"That's one of the things which drove me
out of the show business," said the Press
Agent as he set his empty glass on the table
and signaled to the waiter. "A guy named
Merritt and myself had a snake show in
New York a few years ago which presented
the most complete collection of reptiles ever
gotten together, for it contained specimens
of every species of wriggler known to herpetology
and a good many that were not described
in the books. That man Merritt was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
an inventive genius and had the California
sharp, Burbank, beaten a mile when it came
to inventing new species. When business
was dull he'd take a lot of common, ordinary
snakes into the back room and with a bottle
of peroxide of hydrogen and an assortment
of aniline dyes he would bring out albinos
and spotted and striped snakes which made
the scientists open their eyes and kept 'em
busy inventing new Latin names.</p>

<p>"His biggest success was 'The Great
Two-horned Rhinoceros Serpent,' which
made 'em all sit up for a month, and if I
hadn't seen Merritt working over a common
boa-constrictor with a pair of shark's teeth
and a dish of bird lime it would have fooled
me. That snake was proud of the horns
which Merritt glued on his head, too, and he
used to chase the other snakes around the
cage and butt 'em like a giddy billy-goat.
But in spite of all his ingenuity in originating
new varieties, business was dropping
off, for the public demanded quantity as
well as quality and we had skinned the local
snake market clean. We were sitting in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
office one day, figuring on where we could
get additions to our collection, when a stout,
red-faced little man who had 'sea captain'
written all over him came in and asked if we
wanted any more snakes. Merritt allowed
that we did if the snakes and the prices were
right and asked where we could inspect
them.</p>

<p>"'Well, I've got one that I brought from
Borneo and he's on a ship down in the harbor,'
says the Captain. 'We won't argue
none about the price, for if you'll come down
and take him away you can have him for
nothing.' That made Merritt a little suspicious
and he asked the Captain if it were
his ship.</p>

<p>"'I reckoned it was until two days ago,
when that blame snake broke loose,' he answered
irritably. 'Since then he seems to
own it and not a man jack of the crew will
go below. I've tried to shoot him, but the
beggar's too quick, and I want to discharge
my cargo, so if you ain't afraid to tackle
him, come on.'</p>

<p>"'Me afraid! Me?' says Merritt throwing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
out a chest. 'Why, man alive, I'm the
only living snake charmer who ever dared
handle the dangerous Two-horned Rhinoceros
Serpent, and do you think I'd weaken
before a common Borneo python?'</p>

<p>"'I dunno whether you will or not until
I see you try,' says the Captain. 'I've handled
a Malay crew, which is worse than
serpents, and I've mixed it up with most of
the scum that sails the seven seas, but this
blame snake's got me bluffed all right.
He's three fathom long, as big around as the
mainmast, and made up principally of
muscle and wickedness.'</p>

<p>"'Just watch me. Watch me!' says Merritt.
'I'll use my wonderful hypnotic power
and you'll see the serpent crawl into the bag
at my command, to be easily transported to
this moral and elevating show for exhibition
as an example of the power of mind over
matter.'</p>

<p>"'All right, professor,' says the Captain.
'But if you'll take my advice you'll stow
those shore-going togs and get into working
rig before you tackle him.' Merritt was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
arrayed in all his finery, and if you'd ever
seen him you'd know that that meant a lot,
for when he was flush he could make Solomon
in all his glory, or any other swell
dresser look like a dirty deuce in a new deck.
He had on a light suit with checks which
were so loud they drowned the music of the
orchestra, and a shirt which would make a
summer sunset hide its head in disappointment.
Patent leather shoes with yellow tops
and a white plug hat with a black band
around it completed his costume, except for
a few specimens of yellow diamonds which
adorned his shirt front and cuffs.</p>

<p>"Merritt snorted contemptuously at the
suggestion and we started for the ship.
When we got on board he made a little
speech before he went into the hold, telling
the sailors about his wonderful hypnotic
power and how he would exercise it to charm
the serpent which was preventing their
worthy Captain from reaping the rewards
of his arduous toil and his hardihood in having
braved the perils of the vasty deep. The
sailors listened and grinned, but the Captain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
was getting impatient and suggested that
Merritt get the snake first and give his spiel
afterward, so Merritt went down the ladder
with the bag over his shoulder and we all
rubbered down the hatchway to watch the
capture.</p>

"Merritt was quick enough to get a strangle hold around the snake's neck."</div>



<p>"I knew what he would try to do, for I
had seen him work it before. The way to
get one of those big snakes is to cover his
head with a bag, and then he'll crawl in himself
to get into the dark, which is a serpent's
idea of safety. The more you prod 'em the
faster they'll crawl, and that was the time
when Merritt always made passes with his
hands and muttered gibberish to impress the
spectators. He started in according to programme
as soon as he located the snake,
which was half hidden among a lot of casks.
The snake carried out his part and struck at
the opened bag which Merritt held out to
him, but instead of sticking his head in he
grabbed it with his teeth, and as Merritt held
on he drew him back among the barrels and
there was a pretty fight. Merritt was quick
enough to get a strangle hold around the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
snake's neck and then it kept him busy keeping
out of his coils. The Captain hadn't lied
much about the size of the python&mdash;it was
about thirty feet long&mdash;and Merritt didn't
have time to use any incantation, although
considerable forcible language floated up
through the hatchway. They wiped the
deck with each other for about twenty minutes,
and Merritt had been bumped against
pretty nearly every cask in the hold before
he finally succeeded in drawing the sack over
the snake's head. Then it was easy, and in
spite of his lack of breath the showman in
Merritt asserted itself. He put the sack on
the floor, and with one foot on the neck of
it he prodded the snake's body with the other
while he made mysterious passes with his
hands until the tip of the tail disappeared.
When the sack was securely tied up the
python was hoisted on deck, and Merritt, his
clothing torn and soiled with pitch and the
miscellaneous oily and sticky things which
made up the ship's cargo, climbed up after it.</p>

<p>"'Did you see me?' he asked proudly,
throwing out his chest. 'Did you observe<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
the wonderful hypnotic power which overcame
the prowess of the serpent?'</p>

<p>"'Yes, I noticed it, along toward the
finish,' answered the Captain, grinning
skeptically as he sized up Merritt's dilapidated
apparel. 'But say, professor, what I
can't understand is why you didn't get it
working sooner.'"</p>
